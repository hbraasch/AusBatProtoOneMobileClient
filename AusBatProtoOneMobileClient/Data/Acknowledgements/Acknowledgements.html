<p><strong>ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS</strong></p>
<p style="color:white;">To say that this  project was a collaborative one is a massive understatement. The text has had a  long history of development since elements of it first appeared in Sue&rsquo;s  original &lsquo;Australian Bats&rsquo; guide. It was then edited and updated for the 2008  guide, and now it has undergone further reviews and been condensed to fit the  format of this app. We will, in the future, publish a printed updated field  guide. </p>
<p style="color:white;">Many aspects of this  app are quite new, including photos, calls, distribution maps and interactive keys. The images, both bats and calls,  were produced as a result of many field trips, in particular those from 2018 to  the present. During that time, we were helped by so many people that it might  take a rare degree of stamina to read through all the names. However, without their  assistance this project would never have been possible. From people who helped with field work, gave us somewhere to camp or access  to interesting and amazing places, to those who shared their insights into  batty behaviour and gave us echo-location call files for rare species, or provided  additional images and those who provided advice on the functioning of the app. </pstyle="background-color:white;">
