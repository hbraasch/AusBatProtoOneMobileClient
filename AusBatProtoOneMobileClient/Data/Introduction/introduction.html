<p style="color:#E7E7E7"><strong>Introduction</strong> </p>
<p style="color:#E7E7E7">This app has  been developed as a guide for the identification of Australian bats, providing descriptive  summaries and basic biological information, distributions, and echo-location  call examples. It will be updated as new information comes to hand, and even at  this point, we have two potentially new species to be added! </p>
<p style="color:#E7E7E7">Much of the  content is based on second edition of Sue Churchill&rsquo;s &lsquo;Australian Bats&rsquo;  published in 2008. This in effect, is an updated digital version of the guide  with new information added, new and authenticated images and also including a  significant collaboration with Australasian Bat Society to provide the most  up-to-date distribution maps that exist for Australian bats.</p>
<p style="color:#E7E7E7">Taxonomy is  based, in large part on the treatment provided in the &lsquo;Handbook of the Mammals  of the World&rsquo; &ndash; Volume 9, with minor changes and updates for a few species, but  none of which break new ground! </p>
<p style="color:#E7E7E7">We have also  suggested a set of common names that are consistent with this publication, some  of which depart from our generally accepted Australian standards. For example, <em>Miniopterus </em>are found throughout much of the World and are referred to elsewhere as  &lsquo;Long-fingered&rsquo; bats rather than as &lsquo;Bentwing&rsquo; bats. </p>
<p style="color:#E7E7E7">While these  changes have been suggested, they are not obligatory and there are many  different common names applied to species historically and regionally. Users  are encouraged to make their own independent assessment and use names they feel  are appropriate. <br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br />
  Although a  somewhat tedious point to make &ndash; this publication is not &ldquo;issued for the  purposes of zoological nomenclature, and therefore is not published within the  meaning of the Code&rdquo; (Article 8.3 of the International Code of Zoological  Nomenclature). &nbsp;<br />
  &nbsp;</p>
<p style="color:#E7E7E7">IMPORTANT </p>
<p style="color:#E7E7E7"><strong>Distribution maps</strong> have been provided courtesy of the Australasian Bat  Society and are independently available via their website <a href="https://www.ausbats.org.au/batmap.html">https://www.ausbats.org.au/batmap.html</a> There is also a  contact address on that site if you want to suggest changes. </p>
<p style="color:#E7E7E7"><strong>Echolocation Calls</strong> We recommend that this app should not be used as a basis for the  identification of bats, based on the echo-location calls presented in the  species accounts. This is because the images are examples only, and don&rsquo;t describe  the variation that exists within populations or between different geographic  areas. </p>
<p style="color:#E7E7E7">The <strong>Species Identification keys</strong> are rather technical, and most bats need to be in the hand to allow  accurate identification. Even then many bats are difficult to identify and for  this reason often quite arcane details (such as penis shape or ratios of wing  bone lengths) need to be examined to tell them apart. The keys are interactive,  and we recommend that you start with the top-most characters and work down the  list. As each one is answered, it will disappear, and the number of taxa shown  at the bottom of the screen will hopefully reduce until you have just one left.  However, in some cases you may have more than one. In those cases, you may need  to read the descriptions to arrive at an answer. At all stages in the keys, you  can use distribution to narrow down the suspects (use the &ldquo;Regions&rdquo; tab).&nbsp; </p>
<p style="color:#E7E7E7"><strong>Measurements</strong> These are a series of external measurements,  usually from live bats. They assist in field identification, and most of the  measurements were taken in the field. There is often a difference in  measurements, depending on how bats are held and there can even be differences  between left and right wing measurements of the same animal. Thus, if an  identification comes down to just a millimetre or two difference between  alternative species, then it&rsquo;s quite likely that the id is unsound! &nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
