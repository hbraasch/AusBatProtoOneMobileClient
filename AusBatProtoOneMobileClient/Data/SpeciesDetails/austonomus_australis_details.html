    <p><strong>White-striped Free-tailed Bat</strong><br />Austronomus australis <br />(Gray, 1838)</p>
    <p><br /><strong>Other Names</strong> Tadarida australis, Nyctinomus australis, White-striped Mastiff-bat</p>
    <p><br /><strong>Distribution</strong> Distributed across all of southern Australia, and recently found to be a periodic vagrant to Tasmania, It occurs primarily south of the Tropic of Capricorn and it migrates seasonally. In warmer months from November to February its range is mostly restricted to areas south of about 30o S, in cooler months from April to September up to 1200 km further north and predominantly north of 30o S, with occasional individuals as far north as Katherine, NT and Kununurra WA. April and September are the migration months. This species is endemic to Australia.</p>
    <p><strong>Description</strong> A large distinctive species. Dark brown to black fur with two distinctive bright white stripes along the sides of the belly and onto the wings. This varies, with some individuals having large patches of white fur on the chest and others, such as juveniles, having no white at all. The ears are large and rounded but not joined across the top of the head. A prominent throat pouch is present in both sexes, although it is non-secreting in females. The lips are thick with many short vertical wrinkles and a blunt, rather pig-like nose. The baculum is trifid.</p>
    <p><br /><strong>Roost Habits</strong> White-striped Free-tailed bats are tree dwellers. They roost either solitarily or in groups of up to 25, most commonly less than 10. Maternity colonies are larger with up to 300 individuals. They roost in hollows in old eucalyptus trees with large trunk cavities and multiple entrances, usually through hollow branches. They have been observed to share roosts with Common Brush-tail Possums, but rarely with other bats. White-striped Free-tailed bats make loud audible chirping calls (that can be heard up to 5 m away) from the late afternoon until the colony leaves the roost 30 to 40 minutes after sunset. These social roost calls are distinctly different from the audible echolocation calls produced during flight. If ambient light is sufficient they do not echolocate but leave the roost relying on vision. They launch by dropping about 4 m to gain speed before circling slowly upwards using search calls. A maternity colony of about 50 individuals has been monitored for many years living in an empty brick warehouse at Sydney Olympic Park. In late March, early April the population of the maternity colony decreases as the juveniles become independent and both adults and juveniles disperse. They leave this summer roost to move to warmer areas. White-striped Free-tailed Bats are known to become torpid but not to hibernate.</p>
    <p><strong>Habitat</strong> They use a wide range of habitats including urban areas, forests, woodland, shrub land, open agricultural landscapes with scattered stands of trees, grasslands and deserts, including the Nullarbor. In the Brisbane metropolitan area day-roosts were widely dispersed across the urban landscape but the bats travelled over 6 km to get to the foraging grounds above floodplain habitat, and did little feeding above remnant forest. White-striped Free-tailed Bats appear tolerant of deforestation and capable of persisting in urban landscapes, provided that roost trees are protected.</p>
    <p><strong>Vocalisations and Echolocation calls</strong> <br />This bat has a distinctive audible, constant frequency search mode echolocation call ranging from 11 to 13 kHz. This frequency range is lower than any other bat call in Australia. The search mode call is powerful, clearly audible to humans and carries for hundreds of meters so its presence or absence is very obvious. It can be heard distinctly at night as a regular metallic......ting......ting......ting......ting.</p>
    <p style="padding-left: 40px;"><strong>NSW</strong> Characteristic frequency 10 to 15 kHz (n = 8). Flat, but sloped. May become curved and increase slightly in frequency. Irregular pulses in a sequence may jump to around 15 kHz. Short sequences may be confused with Saccolaimus flaviventris which produce harmonics in the 10-13kHz-frequency range. However S. flaviventris calls often show traces of the dominant harmonic and usually last only a few pulses. <br />Available data shows no indication of variation in call characteristics for this species in New South Wales. <br />Regional Information<br />North East: Characteristic frequency 12 to 14 kHz (n = 1)Western Slopes &amp; Plains: Characteristic frequency 10 to 13 kHz (n = 4). Far West: Characteristic frequency 10 to 13 kHz (n = 3).Sydney Basin, Southern, Riverina: No reference calls from these regions.</p>
    <p style="padding-left: 40px;"><strong>SE</strong> QLD Characteristic frequency 10 to 13 kHz (n = 7). Appears either flattish or curved. If the characteristic frequency is higher than 13 kHz, the pulses will be steep, whereas calls between 13 and 20 kHz from other species are much flatter</p>
    <p style="padding-left: 40px;"><strong>NT</strong> Tadarida australis occurs just to the south of the Top End. It has the lowest known characteristic frequency of any Australian bat species of around 10 - 13 kHz (Reinhold et al., 2001). Its call is therefore clearly audible to the human ear.</p>
