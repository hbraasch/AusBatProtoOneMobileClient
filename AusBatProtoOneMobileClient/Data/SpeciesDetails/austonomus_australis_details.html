<p><strong>White-striped Free-tailed Bat</strong><br />
  <em>Austronomus australis</em> <br />
  (Gray, 1838)</p>
<p><br /><strong>Other Names</strong> <em>Tadarida australis, Nyctinomus australis</em>, White-striped Mastiff-bat<br />
  <br />
<strong>Description </strong>A <strong>large  distinctive species</strong>. <strong>Dark  brown to black fur</strong> with two distinctive <strong>bright white stripes</strong> along the sides  of the belly and onto the wings. This varies, with some individuals having  large patches of white fur on the chest and others, such as juveniles, having  no white at all. The <strong>ears are large and rounded but not joined</strong> across the top of the head. A <strong>prominent  throat pouch is present in both sexes, </strong>although it is  non-secreting in females. The lips are thick with many short vertical wrinkles  and a blunt, rather pig-like nose. The baculum is trifid. </p>
<p><strong>Roost  Habits </strong>White-striped Free-tailed bats are tree dwellers.  They roost either solitarily or in groups of up to 25, most commonly less than  10. Maternity colonies are larger with up to 300 individuals. They roost in  hollows in old eucalyptus trees with large trunk cavities and multiple  entrances, usually through hollow branches. They have been observed to share  roosts with Common Brushtail Possums, but rarely with other bats. White-striped  Free-tailed bats make loud audible chirping calls (that can be heard up to 5 m  away) from the late afternoon until the colony leaves the roost 30 to 40  minutes after sunset. These social roost calls are distinctly different from  the audible echolocation calls produced during flight. If ambient light is sufficient,  they do not echolocate but leave the roost relying on vision. They launch by  dropping about 4 m to gain speed before circling slowly upwards using search  calls. A maternity colony of about 50 individuals has been monitored for many  years living in an empty brick warehouse at Sydney Olympic Park. In late March,  early April the population of the maternity colony decreases as the juveniles  become independent and both adults and juveniles disperse. White-striped  Free-tailed Bats are known to become torpid but not to hibernate.</p>
<p><strong>Habitat </strong>They use a wide range of habitats including urban  areas, forests, woodland, shrub land, open agricultural landscapes with  scattered stands of trees, grasslands and deserts, including the Nullarbor. In  the Brisbane metropolitan area day-roosts were widely dispersed across the  urban landscape but the bats travelled over 6 km to get to the foraging grounds  above floodplain habitat, and did little feeding above remnant forest.  White-striped Free-tailed Bats appear tolerant of deforestation and capable of  persisting in urban landscapes, provided that roost trees are protected.</p>
<p><strong>Vocalisations  and Echolocation calls </strong><br />
  This bat has a  distinctive audible, constant frequency search mode echolocation call ranging  from 11 to 13 kHz. This frequency range is lower than any other bat call in  Australia. The search mode call is powerful, clearly audible to humans and  carries for hundreds of meters so its presence or absence is very obvious. It  can be heard distinctly at night as a regular  metallic......ting......ting......ting......ting.</p>
