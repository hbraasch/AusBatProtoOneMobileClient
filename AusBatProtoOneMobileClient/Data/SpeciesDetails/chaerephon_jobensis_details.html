<p><strong>Northern Free-tailed Bat</strong> <br>
  <em>Chaerephon jobensis</em><br>  
  (Miller, 1902)
  
</p>
<p><strong>Other Names</strong> <em>Nyctinomus plicatus, Nyctinomus plicatus, Tadarida jobensis</em>, Northern Mastiff-bat, Greater Northern Free-tailed Bat. </p>
<p> <strong>Description</strong> The fur on the back is short and a rich dark reddish brown to smoky black. The fur on the belly is a lighter grey brown. There is no white stripe. The lips are thick and fleshy with large numbers of deep vertical wrinkles and the nose is blunt and rather pig-like. The ears are large, round and joined across the top of the head by a low band of skin. The skull rises slightly from the snout to the top of the head (sinuate) with a sagittal crest, there is no throat pouch in either sex. They are quite heavy 20.4 g (16 to 38 g) bats for their size with a forearm of 49.2 mm (46.5 to 51.5 mm). The third molar is slightly reduced. There is no baculum.  </p>
<p><strong>Roost Habits</strong> Northern Free-tailed Bats usually roost in large tree hollows in colonies of 10 to 100, but they have also been found in caves and buildings in colonies of up to 300. An interesting roost was found in cracks in the wooden pylons of Derby Jetty, in the Kimberley. The bats were discovered because during the day their social calls could be heard. Up to 40 roosts were found with colonies of mostly 1 to 3 but up to 7 bats. The cracks were narrow, about 2 to 3 cm but quite long and the roosts were vertical, hanging directly over the water. The bats left the roosts of an evening by dropping from the bridge towards the water up to 10 m below and making their way to shore under the bridge. Unfortunately, the pylons have now been replaced with steel ones and the bats have gone. Recently a large colony was found in a horizontal split in a sandstone cliff in the Kimberley. The bats were calling during the day, making loud chirping sounds that could be heard 30 m away. They shared the roost with the North Australian Long-fingered Bat, <em>Miniopterus o. orianae</em>. In the Top End a small colony roosting in a large tree hollow shared its roost with several Yellow-bellied Sheath-tailed Bats, <em>Saccolaimus flaviventris</em>.  </p>
<p><strong>Habitat</strong> Found from sea level to 1,400 m elevation, they occur in mangroves, monsoon forests, paperbark lined creeks, tall open forest, tropical savanna, riverine forest, open Bauhinia shrub land, rocky hillsides, eucalyptus woodlands, monsoon thickets and frequently along the narrow bands of river red gums that fringe the dry beds of ephemeral river systems. They also forage over cane fields and other croplands in irrigated farmland.  </p>
<p><strong>Vocalisations and Echolocation calls</strong>  Their echolocation calls have a characteristic frequency of 19.8 kHz (16.1 to 23.6 kHz). They often fly in pairs and this tends to produce paired echolocation calls at alternating frequencies. Their echolocation calls are very loud and of a low frequency (16 to 23 kHz) and can be audible to humans. Like <em>Austronomus australis</em>, they can be very vocal at the roost and their audible social calls can be heard by humans some distance away, alerting observers to the location of their roosts.  </p>
