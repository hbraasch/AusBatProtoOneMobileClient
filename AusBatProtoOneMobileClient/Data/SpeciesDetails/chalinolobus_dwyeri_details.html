  <em>Chalinolobus  dwyeri </em><br>
Ryan, 1966 </p>
<p><strong>Description</strong> A caricature of a <em>Chalinolobus</em>, with its large ears and curly wattles, the pied bat has <strong>uniform glossy black fur on the back</strong>. The belly is washed with brown, usually with a <strong>band of bright white fur along the sides of the body</strong> where the wing membranes join. These <strong>white lateral stripes converge in the pubic region to form a  V-shape</strong>. <strong>Ears  are very large</strong> and easily touch when pressed together above the  head. The <strong>lobe on the lower outer edge of the ear</strong> <strong>near the corner of the mouth is</strong> <strong>well developed</strong>. A second lobe of skin along the side of the lower lip is also well  developed. </p>
<p><strong>Habitat</strong> This species is commonly associated with a variety of habitats in  proximity to roosting areas in cliff rock faces, boulder piles and gorges.  These habitats most commonly encompass woodlands, forests and associated  grasslands. They also occur in sub-alpine woodland, along the edge of  rainforest tracts and wet sclerophyll forest and <em>Callitris </em>dominated forest. </p>
<p>In the Sydney  basin they have been found to be common in areas of high fertility soils in wet  sclerophyll forests along the edges of sandstone escarpments and often forage  along forest-grassland border areas, with fewer calls recorded in open areas or  in the forest. They also forage along creeks or moist drainage gullies containing  riparian vegetation. </p>
<p><strong>Roost  Habits</strong> These bats roost in caves, overhangs, crevices  in cliffs and abandoned mines, individually or in colonies of up to 40, often clustered  in indentations in the ceiling. They prefer the twilight areas of the caves not  far from the entrance. Males have been found during the winter in deep torpor  roosting alone in abandoned mines and one juvenile male was found overwintering  in an abandoned fairy martin nest. </p>
<p>In mid-November  a maternity colony of 40 females and newborn twins was found in a sandstone  cave near Coonabarabran. The bats were clustered into two separate cracks in  the twilight area in the cave ceiling. The temperature ranged from 15.5 to 18.5  degrees and 51 to 76% humidity.<br>

  There is no  evidence to suggest that these bats use tree hollows.</p>
<p><strong>Diet,  Flight and Foraging </strong>These bats are insectivorous, but no details are  known. They fly relatively slowly with rapid but shallow wing beats. Their  flight is direct and moderately manoeuvrable. I (S.C.) have watched them fly  low along a creek bed, but they also fly at mid-canopy level 6 to 10 m above  the ground. Radio-tracking studies in the Blue mountains have shown that  females have larger foraging areas than males, with both sexes showing high  loyalty to preferred foraging areas even after several months. Females foraged  further from the roost than males. Forage with a slow fluttery flight along  forest edges at mid to upper canopy height and around tree crowns occasionally  diving down to capture prey. Males had a smaller foraging range (71Ha) than  females (113Ha). Most bats travelled less than 1 km from the roost (one  individual was recorded traveling 2.5 km). </p>
<p><strong>Vocalisations  and Echolocation calls </strong></p>
<p>Characteristic  frequency between 21.5 and 25.5 kHz (n = 14). Curved with up sweeping, down  sweeping or no tail. Pulses often alternate in frequency and can easily be  distinguished from other species by the combination of the low frequency and the  distinct pattern of alternation often present in search phase calls. Data  indicates that this species does not noticeably vary its call throughout its  range.</p>
