<p> <strong>Gould's Wattled Bat<br>
</strong><em>Chalinolobus gouldii</em><br />
(Gray, 1838)</p>
<p><br />
  <strong>Description </strong>An amazingly adaptable bat that is found in the  full spectrum of the Australian climatic zones. It has a delightful habit of &lsquo;murmuring&rsquo;  when held in the hand. The <strong>fur is brown</strong> <strong>on the back and belly</strong> with <strong>contrasting</strong> dark <strong>blackish fur on the head and shoulders</strong>. Specimens from northern Australia may be almost totally black. The <strong>muzzle is short</strong>, the <strong>ears are short and broad. </strong>The back edge of  the ear extends to form <strong>a large lobe of  skin</strong> (wattle) <strong>at the  corner of the mouth</strong> and a secondary long narrow lobe along the lower  lip. It shows variation in body size throughout its range. Individuals from  northern Australia are smaller than those from southern Australia and those  from eastern Australia are smaller than western individuals. There is no  significant difference in size between males and females. </p>
<p><strong>Habitat </strong>This ubiquitous bat is found in virtually all  habitats throughout Australia from alpine regions to tropical rainforests,  eucalypt forests and woodlands, deserts, grasslands, agricultural land and  urban areas. They do not occur on the treeless plains of the Nullarbor and are  very rare in northern tropical savannah woodlands with only a very small number  of records from Cape York, Top End and Kimberley.</p>
<p><strong>Roost  Habits </strong>Gould's Wattled Bats roost most commonly in tree  hollows and hollow limbs of living mature trees, particularly river red gums (<em>Eucalyptus camaldulensis</em>) and cypress  pines (<em>Callitris</em>). Other recorded roosts include buildings, a tree stump, amongst  leaves, in a roll of canvas, and even in the exhaust pipe of a tractor. Females  form colonies of 8 to 40 in tree hollows and up to 80 in buildings. Males are  usually solitary but have been found sharing a tree hollow roost with several  other bat species and feather-tail gliders (<em>Acrobates  pygmaeus</em>). </p>
<p><strong>Diet,  Flight and Foraging </strong>Bugs and moths are the major food items,  including Bogong moths in the southern highlands. A wide variety of prey  including winged and wingless ants, cockroaches, stoneflies, katydids, field  crickets, cicadas, bugs, beetles, flies and caterpillars have been reported  from scats and stomach remains. They regularly forage from 5 to 10 kilometres  from their roost site and occasionally up to 15 kilometres away. They fly just  below or within the lower level of the tree canopy and along the forest edges,  creek lines and around isolated paddock trees. They have an agile flight that  is faster than that of most other vespertilionids and tend to fly on a fixed  horizontal plane with abrupt zigzag changes of course, frequently rolling to  near vertical banking angles during horizontal turns. They can fly at speeds of  up to 36 km per hour but cruising speed is usually from 11 to 18 kmh. </p>
<p><strong>Vocalisations and Echolocation calls</strong></p>
<p>Characteristic  frequency is between 25 and 34kHz (n = 122). Usually curved, with a  down-sweeping tail or no tail. Consecutive pulses usually alternate in  frequency although when &lsquo;cruising&rsquo; in open spaces, calls may even out and lose  alternation. When long sequences are recorded, some alternation is usually seen,  however. Good quality calls should not be confused with any other species. </p>
