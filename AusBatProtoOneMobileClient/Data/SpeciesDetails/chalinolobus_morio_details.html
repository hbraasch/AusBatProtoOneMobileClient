<p> <strong>Chocolate Wattled Bat</strong><br>
        <em>Chalinolobus morio</em><br />
(Gray, 1841)</p>
<p><br />
<strong>Other  Names </strong>Chocolate Bat</p>
<p><strong>Description</strong> A common species of southern Australia the fur is a uniform <strong>milk chocolate brown on the back</strong> <strong>and the belly</strong>. Central Australian bats are light brown. The <strong>head is steeply domed with a short muzzle</strong>, usually with a <strong>distinct ridge of  fur across the muzzle</strong>. The <strong>ears  are short and broad</strong> and will barely or not quite meet if pressed  together across the top of the head. The tragus is short, broad and strongly  curved forward with a pointed tip. There is a <strong>moderate  development of the wattle;</strong> the lobe at the lower outer  margin of the ear near the corner of the mouth is small, but the <strong>secondary lobe along the lower lip is semicircular and easily  seen</strong>. These lobes and the shape of the tragus, help  to distinguish this species from the Large Forest Bat, <em>Vespadelus darlingtoni</em>, which is of a  similar size and colour. </p>
<p><strong>Roost  Habits</strong> These bats roost in tree hollows, houses, under  the exfoliating bark of trees, fairy martin nests, culverts, bridges as well as  in caves (in the south-west and Nullarbor areas). Most roosts are in trees.  Female colonies of 6 to 70 have been found. Males usually roost alone. Larger  colonies of up to 400 have been recorded in buildings and caves. Colony sizes  may be many times greater than the numbers observed at any one time as each bat  has several roosts and while maternity colonies are often sedentary, males and  non-breeding females move frequently between alternate roosts. </p>
<p><strong>Habitat</strong> They occur in rainforest, wet and dry sclerophyll forest, woodlands  and mallee but are also found in shrub lands and treeless regions such as the  Nullarbor. In inland areas their distribution tends to follow watercourses as  these provide large trees for roosts. They prefer continuous forests to small  forest patches. </p>
<p><strong>Diet,  Flight and Foraging </strong>&nbsp;These bats  appear to be opportunistic foragers and their choice of prey tends to reflect  the availability of aerial insects. They feed predominantly on moths and  beetles but also take termites and occasional flies, bugs, ants, lacewings and  wasps. They forage up to five kilometres from their roost site, or in some  cases, up to 20km, and use the same relatively small foraging area each night.  Their flight is usually fast and direct, with rapid wing beats. Gliding  attack-manoeuvres are carried out with considerable agility, usually with  sudden vertical drops. They mostly forage in the open zone between the top of  the understory and the canopy although they sometimes fly low along forest  trails. They have been recorded at speeds of 28km/hr and are one of the most  agile bats. </p>
<p><strong>Vocalisations  and Vocalisations and Echolocation calls s </strong></p>
<p>Characteristic  frequency between 46.5 and 53 kHz (n = 84). Curved with down sweeping tail.  Consecutive pulses sometimes show slight alternation in shape. Alternate pulses  have lower maximum frequency or sometimes the frequency of the knee appears to  step up and down. Can generally be distinguished from other species calling at  similar frequencies by a down sweeping tail which is often present in search  phase calls. </p>
