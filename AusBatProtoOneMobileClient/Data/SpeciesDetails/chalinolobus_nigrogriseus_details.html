        <em>Chalinolobus nigrogriseus</em><br />
  (Gould 1856)</p>
<p><br />
<strong>Other  Names</strong> Hoary bat</p>
<p><strong>Description</strong> A gentle animal, the hoary Wattled Bat has <strong>dark grey to black fur on the back</strong> and <strong>greyish brown on the belly,</strong> with a <strong>frosting of white tips to the hairs</strong>, giving a hoary appearance (some individuals have no white frosting). <strong>The lobe (wattle)</strong> at the base of the outer margin of the ear near the corner of the  mouth <strong>is poorly developed</strong> and the <strong>secondary lobe is reduced to</strong> <strong>a thin ribbon of skin</strong> along the lower lip. There is an east to west variation in size, and  the amount of white frosting to the fur. Western Australian individuals are  smaller with considerably more frosting than Queensland bats which may be  almost black. The Little Pied Bat, <strong><em>C.  picatus,</em></strong><strong> can be distinguished by</strong> the presence of a <strong>notch in the inner  upper incisor</strong>.</p>
<p><strong>Roost  Habits</strong> Hoary Wattled Bats are forest dwellers that  roost in small hollows in eucalypt trees. They have also occasionally been  found to roost in rock crevices. In Papua New Guinea a maternity colony of  several hundred females and their young were found in the roof of a building in  November. They can often be seen flying about just after sunset, having left  their roost site well before other bat species have emerged.</p>
<p><strong>Habitat</strong> They occur in many habitat types, including monsoon forest, tall open  forest, open woodland, dry sclerophyll forest, river red gum riparian woodland,  littoral rainforest, deciduous vine thickets, coastal scrub, sand dunes,  spinifex covered hills, grasslands and floodplains. They fly fast below the  canopy level so forests with naturally sparse understorey layers may provide  the best habitat. </p>
<p><strong>Diet  and Foraging</strong> In their diet they show a preference for  beetles, ants and moths but they also eat a wide variety of prey including  spiders, mantids, earwigs, crickets, grasshoppers, cockroaches, cicadas, bugs,  flies and lacewings. Hoary Wattled Bats commonly forage along water courses and  in swampy areas in northern Australia, and are also found around isolated dams  and waterholes in drier areas. They have been observed at twilight foraging  along the edge of forest, along the tops of forest crowns and circling isolated  trees about 5 m from the crown edge. Their foraging flight is moderately fast  with speeds of up to 34 km/hr recorded. They are agile and respond to prey at a  range of 3 to 5 m making frequent course changes in response to evasive  manoeuvres by the prey.</p>
<p><strong>Vocalisations  and Vocalisations and Echolocation calls s&nbsp; </strong></p>
<p>Characteristic  frequency 36 to 40 kHz. Usually with no tail or occasionally up sweeping tail. The  calls may be difficult to distinguish from <em>Scotorepens greyii</em> where  these species overlap in range. Reinhold <em>et  al.</em> (2001) reports that <em>C. nigrogriseus</em> have  relatively longer characteristic and tail sections, usually 2/3 or more of the  total pulse which, in conjunction with the lack of up-sweeping tail, may help  to differentiate them. </p>
