        <em>Chalinolobus picatus</em><br />
(Gould, 1852)</p>
<p><br />
<strong>Other  Names</strong> Pied Bat</p>
<p><strong>&nbsp;</strong><strong>Description</strong> This beautiful bat is the smallest species in the genus. The <strong>fur is a uniform</strong> <strong>glossy black on the back</strong>, faintly <strong>washed with grey on the belly</strong>. There  are <strong>two white stripes running along the sides of  the body</strong> <strong>that  converge to form a V in the pubic region</strong>. The long black  fur on the back extends well onto the tail membrane where it grades into a  fringe of brownish black hairs. The <strong>ears  are small</strong> and are too short to meet or only barely touch  when pressed together across the top of the head. The <strong>lobe at the base of the outer margin of the ear is poorly  developed but the secondary lobe along the lower lip is easily seen</strong>. It differs from the hoary Wattled Bat, <em>C. nigrogriseus,</em> in having a  notch in the inner upper incisor. </p>
<p><strong>Roost  Habits</strong> They roost in trees, caves, abandoned mines and  buildings. One colony containing 38 bats (both sexes) was recorded in an  abandoned house. Another large colony of about 50 (both sexes) has been  roosting in a shed for over 20 years. Most colonies in caves and mines contain  less than 10. Roost sites in caves are usually warm and dry but they can  tolerate roost temperatures of over 40oC. Roosts have been found in <em>Casuarina pauper</em>, mulga,  bloodwoods and other large eucalypts. Favoured hollows are in large mature  trees with dead limbs, and dead trees that have fallen over leaving a hollowed  stump. The hollow entrances are variable sizes but open into large cavities,  midway up the trunk. Pied bats often roost alone and move roost location most  days, although remaining in the same general area (all roosts within 200 m). </p>
<p>Michael Pennay  made a remarkable observation of a colony of these small bats that roosted in a  clump of small dead mulga near Bourke. Each night they commuted 17 km to forage  in a dry creek bed and in the morning returned to the same mulga clump, a 34 km  round trip. It is not as though dead mulga were in short supply around Bourke!  He also radio-tracked a male that roosted alone under a rock in a boulder pile.</p>
<p><strong>Habitat</strong> Little Pied Bats occur in dry forest, woodland and mallee, and roost  mainly in dead tree hollows. They are sometimes found in man-made structures  such as shearing sheds and abandoned buildings.<br>
  The species appears  to be most common in the mallee and mixed species woodlands of the Willandra  Lakes area of New South Wales and the mulga and riverine open forest  communities in central western Queensland. They have also been caught in dry  open forest, open woodland, chenopod shrub-lands, <em>Callitris</em> forest and <em>Casuarina pauper</em> woodlands. </p>
<p><strong>Diet,  Flight and Foraging </strong>C.<em> picatus</em> flight is fast and highly manoeuvrable, changing  direction often. They fly close to the vegetation. They have been seen to glean  from the canopy of <em>Casuarina</em> by flying amongst the foliage. They were observed to glean from the  walls of a woolshed, with a distinct up and down sweeping action. The flight  was composed of many darting actions and hunting involved rapid swoops and  dives, flying at about 2 to 4 m above the ground. A single stomach content  examination found only moths. </p>
<p><strong>Vocalisations  and Vocalisations and Echolocation calls</strong> Characteristic  frequency between 38.5 and 43 kHz (n = 9). Curved. Pulses often alternate in  frequency. Good quality calls should not be confused with any other species.  Characteristic frequency is usually higher than <em>Scotorepens greyii</em>, and  lower than <em>Vespadelus vulturnus</em>. Non alternating calls below 40 kHz may  be confused with <em>Scotorepens greyii</em>. There is insufficient data to  indicate if this species has regional call variations.</p>
