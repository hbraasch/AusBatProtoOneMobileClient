        <strong>Naked-backed Fruit Bat</strong><br>
        <em>Dobsonia magna</em><br />
        (Thomas, 1905)
    </p>
    <p>
        <br />
        <strong>Other  Names</strong> <em>Dobsonia  moluccensis magna</em>, <em>Dobsonia  moluccense</em>, Bare-backed Fruit Bat.
    </p>
    <p><strong>Taxonomy</strong> Although <em>Dobsonia magna</em> is larger, there is some taxonomic uncertainty about its relationship  to <em>D. moluccensis, </em>recent DNA analysis using limited samples was inconclusive. </p>
    <p><strong>Description</strong> This <strong>large and distinctive Fruit Bat </strong>differs from Flying Foxes in its <strong>unusual  wings that join along the mid-line of the back </strong>rather than along the sides of the body. The furless wings give the <strong>impression of a hairless back</strong>. The  back is fully furred under the wings where deep pockets have been formed on  either side of the body. The <strong>fur on  the shoulders and head is black brown</strong>. The <strong>belly is a lighter grey brown and sparsely furred</strong>. There is a short tail. <strong>Claws  on the wings and feet are white </strong>and there is no  claw on the second digit of the wing<strong>.</strong> Males are usually heavier than females and can weigh up to 600 g,  maximum weight for females is 525 g. Forearms Although a large and strong bat  they are surprisingly gentle when handled.<strong> </strong>The unusual wing shape causes this bat to have a  characteristic sound in flight, a hollow 'pock-pock-pock', caused by the air  compressing in the spaces under the wing membrane pockets on its back.</p>
    <p>The eyes are  large and create an obvious eye-shine in a cave or in the forest when viewed  with a spotlight. There are two pair of musk producing sebaceous glands. One  pair on the shoulders near the wing junction and another pair that runs from  the base of the ears towards the corner of the mouth. These glands become more  prominent in males during the breeding season.&nbsp; </p>
    <p><strong>Roost Habits</strong> Naked-backed Fruit Bats live in small colonies of less than 100 In  Australia, although they are found in colonies of many thousands in New Guinea.  They usually roost in twilight conditions in caves, under boulder piles, and in  disused mines and concrete bunkers, as well as in dark rainforest thickets and  large tree hollows. A colony of 13 that I (S.C.) came across near Iron Range  was roosting in a pile of large granite boulders 2 to 3 m above the ground.  Initially the bats were hanging from the walls alone or in pairs but when  disturbed they flew off and on return, roosted together clumped into a single  tight mass. </p>
    <p>They are highly  manoeuvrable and as an individual approaches a group of roosting bats they are  able to hover, repeatedly reverse direction and then slowly fly in to land by  swinging their feet upwards to grab onto the roost. If disturbed at the roost  they can be very vocal, otherwise there are only occasional aggressive calls  between individuals coupled with &ldquo;wing boxing&rdquo; as they attempt to displace each  other from mates or favoured roost positions. </p>
    <p>Their ability to  dissipate body heat is up to 180% of that expected for a mammal of its body  weight. This is due to the large area of wing membrane that acts as a radiator,  allowing them to shed heat easily in flight and while at the roost. Predators  include large Amethystine pythons (<em>Morelia  amethistina</em>). Large fur-dwelling batflies are common  (particularly in large cave colonies). They include <em>Megastrebla parvior</em> and <em>M. gigantea. </em>In New Guinea,  terrestrial leaches often hang from cave ceilings and have been observed to  drop onto the bats to feed. </p>
    <p><strong>Habitat </strong>Found from sea level to 2,770 m elevation.  Primary and secondary rainforest, gallery forest and tropical woodlands. They  are rare in dry woodlands and savanna.</p>
    <p><strong>Diet,  Flight and Foraging </strong>&nbsp;They feed  on a variety of native fruits (particularly <em>Ficus</em>, <em>Terminalia</em>, and <em>Callophylum</em>), and eucalypt blossom, the Northern Bloodwood, <em>Corymbia polycarpa</em> is one of its  favourite food trees. They also enjoy domesticated fruit such as Banana, <em>Musa spp</em>, Papaya, <em>Carica papaya</em> and Football  fruit, <em>Pangium edule</em>. Like Flying Foxes they tend to follow water courses when commuting  between roost and feeding areas but unlike them they forage alone and are  silent at night. </p>
