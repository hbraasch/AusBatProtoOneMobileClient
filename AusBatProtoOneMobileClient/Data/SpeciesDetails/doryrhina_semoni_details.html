<p> <strong>Semon's Leaf-nosed Bat</strong><br>
    <em><strong>Doryrhina semoni</strong></em><br />
(Matschie, 1903)</p>
<p><br />
<strong>Other  Names</strong> <em>Hipposideros  semoni, </em>Semon&rsquo;s Horseshoe Bat, Greater Wart-nosed  Horseshoe Bat </p>
<p><strong>Taxonomy</strong> Recently moved to the genus <em>Doryrhina</em> from <em>Hipposideros, </em>based on a revision of  African bats by Foley <em>et al.</em> 2017</p>
<p><strong>Description</strong> A delicate, finely built species with a forearm of 43.1 to 50.4 mm  and weight of 5.7 to 8.7 grams. The <strong>ears  are very long and narrow</strong>, with an <strong>acute narrow point, </strong>and lacking an  anti-tragus. The <strong>fur is long, dark smoky grey to brown </strong>and has a ruffled appearance. It is <strong>slightly  lighter on the belly</strong>. No orange or rufous morphs are known. A  distinctive feature is the square-shaped nose-leaf with a large <strong>wart like projection in the centre of the nose leaf</strong> and the small secondary wart on the posterior nose-leaf. There are  two lateral leaflets, the outer one joins the posterior leaf. There are  relatively large and sculpted foliations around the deep nostrils. The  posterior leaf is thin and divided into four of cells. </p>
<p><strong>Roost  Habits</strong> Semon's Leaf-nosed Bat has been found roosting  in some strange places. These include an oven, a clothes closet, a picture rail  in an unoccupied house and even hanging from the door handle of a car. They  have more commonly been reported roosting in caves and in tree hollows. I have  caught this bat in a small granite boulder cave with a roost microclimate no  different to that of the surrounding rainforest. They have been caught in  groups of up to 8 individuals in mist nets in rainforest. Three were recorded  near Cooktown, roosting alone in different rock fissures in limestone tower karst.  Roosts were less than 7 m from the entrance in the twilight zone. They usually  roost alone but a colony of 10 individuals has been recorded. Most roost  microclimates are very similar to outside conditions but in one complex cave  system they were found in small dead-end passages that were warm and humid.  They are uncommon and restricted to just a few areas but are consistently  captured in low numbers. </p>
<p><strong>Habitat</strong> Tropical rainforest, gallery forest, monsoon forest, wet sclerophyll  forest and open savanna woodland.</p>
<p><strong>Diet,  Flight and Foraging </strong>They are known to eat moths. The presence of  huntsman spider and beetle remains under two cave roosts suggest that these may  form part of their diet. To catch huntsman spiders the bats would need to be  partial gleaners, taking prey from surfaces such as rock faces, tree trunks or  from the ground. Bats released in the rainforest flew low, within a metre of  the ground. Like other species of <em>Hipposideros</em>, the flight was relatively slow and manoeuvrable as they carefully  negotiated their way through the undergrowth. Bats observed exiting a cave  roost after sunset, were observed to fly without echolocating in the moonlight,  relying on vision and memory to negotiate obstacles. We have watched one flying  low (20 cm) to the ground along a semi-dry, rocky waterway, circling a small  pool and flying back and forth along the rock bank. It flew very slowly, much  like the Dusky Leaf-nosed Bat, <em>Hipposideros  ater</em> and tended to stay very close to surfaces such  as rocks and shrubs and rarely moved far into open space. It roosted on a small  tree, constantly rotating its body back and forth with its ears twitching as it  echolocated and searched its surroundings. After 10 minutes or so it moved on.  We have seen them fly in surprisingly strong wind by keeping close to the  ground and staying in eddies. They negotiate mist nets with ease. </p>
<p><strong>Echolocation</strong> The echolocation calls of this species are unusual in that they show  a sexual dimorphism, with males and females producing calls of different frequencies.  Males call at 94 kHz and females call at 74 kHz. </p>
