        <em>Doryrhina stenotis</em><br />
  (Thomas, 1913)</p>
<p><br />
<strong>Other  Names</strong> <em>Hipposideros  stenotis, </em>Northern Horseshoe Bat, Lesser Wart-nosed  Horseshoe Bat </p>
<p><strong>Taxonomy</strong> Recently moved to the genus <em>Doryrhina</em> from <em>Hipposideros, </em>based on a revision of African bats by Foley <em>et al.</em> 2017.</p>
<p><strong>Description</strong> The Northern Leaf-nosed Bat, <em>Doryrhina stenotis</em> is a delicate and finely built species with a forearm length of 41.9  to 45.6 mm and weight of 4.6 to 6.7 grams. The ears are <strong>long and sharply pointed,</strong> extending well  beyond the fur. This is a feature that can be clearly seen from a distance when  the bat is roosting. The ears lack an anti-tragus. The <strong>fur on the back is grey to brown</strong> and slightly lighter on the belly. Their <strong>fur is very long and fine with a white base</strong> to the hairs, giving a rather ruffled and untidy appearance. No  orange or rufous morphs are known. A distinctive feature is the square-shaped  nose-leaf with a large <strong>wart like  projection in the centre of the nose leaf</strong> and the  small secondary wart on the posterior nose-leaf. There are two lateral  leaflets, the outer one joins the posterior leaf. There are sculpted foliations  around the deep nostrils. The posterior leaf is thin and divided into four of  cells. It is similar to Semon's Leaf-nosed Bat, <em>D. semoni,</em> of eastern Queensland,  which is slightly larger (forearm length 43.1 to 50.5 mm) and has larger  wart-like projections on the nose leaf. </p>
<p><strong>Roost  Habits</strong> Northern Leaf-nosed Bats roost in shallow  sandstone caves, overhangs, boulder piles, road culverts and disused mines.  They have not been found in limestone caves despite extensive searches in the  Northern Territory. Individuals roost alone, usually in well separated pairs or  in small (maternity) colonies of 6&ndash;12 bats. Roost microclimates are  characterised by low humidity and bats roost close (less than 50 m) to the  entrance, often in the twilight zone (recorded temperature of 27oC and 46%  humidity). Most caves are small, shallow overhangs or splits in sandstone  cliffs. These bats hang by their toes from the ceiling, usually away from the  walls and do not cluster. when there are two at the roost they are at least 30  cm apart. They are easily overlooked. I have known one to wait quietly at its  roost, 50 cm off the ground, in a boulder pile, as I crawled past it only  centimetres away. I saw it for the first time as I turned around to leave the  cave. In mines they appear to be more alert and slip away quickly and quietly  hugging the rock wall when disturbed, usually flying outside rather than  entering the deeper, more humid areas of the mine. They are seldom caught in  mist nets or bat traps in the open. These bats could be confused with the Dusky  Leaf-nosed Bat, <em>H. ater</em>, but  their long pointed ears are noticeable at the roost and they roost in different  microclimates (<em>H. ater </em>requiring  humid roosts); while on the wing they are larger, with a more direct flight.  Despite extensive bat surveys in places such as Kakadu National Park there are  few records of this species and it is thought to be genuinely rare. </p>
<p><strong>Habitat</strong> The Northern Leaf-nosed Bats is closely associated with steep hills,  rocky outcrops and escarpments. It has been recorded in monsoon thickets,  deciduous vine thickets, tall open forest, open eucalypt woodland (Darwin  woollybutt <em>Eucalyptus miniata</em>, Darwin box <em>E. tectifica</em>, Darwin stringybark <em>E.  tetradonta</em>, Round-leaved Bloodwood <em>E. latifolia</em> with grassland  or shrubland understories, floodplains, open grassland, and spinifex covered  hills. In the Kimberley, it has been caught along creeks and pools fringed by  stands of Broad leaved Paperbark, <em>Melaleuca  leucadendra</em>, Silver tea-tree, <em>M. argentea</em>, <em>Pandanus </em>spp. and Rock fig <em>Ficus platypoda</em>. Their  distribution is influenced by the availability of suitable roost sites. On the  Kimberley Islands they were found roosting in sandstone caves in savanna  woodland and escarpment with hummock grass, <em>Ficus</em> and <em>Calytrix. </em></p>
