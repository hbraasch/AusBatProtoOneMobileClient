        <em>Falsistrellus mackenziei</em><br />
  (Kitchener,  Caputi and Jones, 1986)</p>
<p><br />
<strong>Other  Names</strong>Western  Falsistrelle, <em>Pipistrellus tasmaniensis</em>.</p>
<p><strong>Description</strong> The largest vespertilionid in Western Australia, this is a large and  robust bat. The fur on the back is dark brown with a light cinnamon belly. The  snout is naked forward of the eyes; the slender ears extend well above the head  and overlap when pressed together. The ears are triangular with a rounded tip  that curves backward and there is a characteristic notch on the outer margin  near the tips. The tragus is more than half the length of the ear, with a  moderate sized lobe at the rear base and narrowing to a slightly rounded tip.  The penis is hairy. This bat has two pairs of upper incisors, but the outer  pair are very small and hard to see. There is a gap between the upper canines  and the incisor teeth. </p>
<p><strong>Habitat</strong> Western False Pipistrelles are restricted to areas in or adjacent to  stands of mature forest, usually in pre-senescent types of old growth. It is  estimated that 12 - 15% of the south-western forests remain as old growth.  Typically these bats are found in wet sclerophyll forest dominated by Karri (<em>Eucalyptus diversicolor</em>), and in the  high rainfall zones of the Jarrah (<em>E.  marginata</em>) and Tuart (<em>E.  gomphocephala</em>) dry sclerophyll forests. They have been  recorded in mixed Tuart-Jarrah tall woodlands on the adjacent coastal plains.  Marri (<em>E. calophylla</em>) and Tingle (<em>Eucalyptus jacksonii</em>) forest and adjoining  open woodland. Sheoak (<em>Casuarina heugeliana</em>) and Peppermint (<em>Agonis  flexuosa</em>) trees are often co-dominant at their collection  localities. They have also been captured in <em>Banksia</em> woodlands on the Swan coastal plain.</p>
<p><strong>Roost  Habits</strong> These gregarious bats roost in hollow trees,  branches and stumps. They have been found in colonies of 5 to 30. A group of  five bats released in the forest gathered around the canopy of one tree before  settling together on a dead branch to roost. The sexes segregate for roosting  at least during much of the spring and early summer when the young are being  reared. A colony of about 30 individuals roosted in a Karri tree hollow about  15 m above the ground. </p>
<p><strong>Diet,  Flight and Foraging </strong>These bats have been caught in mist nets set 4 to  8 meters above the ground. Their flight is reported as fast and direct with  occasional abrupt turns as they forage in the air space amongst the massive  tree trunks between the understory and high canopy. They catch airborne insect  prey. They have also been caught in bat traps and mist nets set at normal  height along forest tracks (S. Churchill, B. Thomson, pers. comm).</p>
<p>This species is  the largest of the air-superiority insectivore bats that inhabit the south-west  forests of Western Australia. Because of their large size (20 gm) they are  likely to need a particularly productive habitat to survive hard times. This  bat had a historical range that takes in the south-west corner of the State  from Cape Leeuwin, past Albany and north up the Darling Range to the latitude  of Perth. Recent examination of its preferred climate has shown a marked  reduction in rainfall and relative humidity over the last 30 years. The data  and climate modeling projections suggest that <em>F.  mackenziei</em> may soon retreat from the areas to the south and  east of Perth and perhaps even from the coastal plains between Mandurah and  Cape Leeuwin. Clearly this species is under threat from global warming and the  ongoing drying of the South-west corner of Western Australia that is projected  by current climate models.&nbsp; </p>
<p><strong>Vocalisation  and Echolocation</strong> Their echolocation calls are of a relatively low  frequency. They have a steep, frequency modulated call, with the lowest  frequency of 30 kHz, peak energy between 32 and 24 kHz and a duration of about  12 milliseconds.</p>
