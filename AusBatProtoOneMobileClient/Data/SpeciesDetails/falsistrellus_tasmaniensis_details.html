  <em>Falsistrellus  tasmaniensis </em><br>
(Gould, 1858)</p>
<p><strong>Other  Names</strong> Eastern  Falsistrelle, Tasmanian Pipistrelle, <em>Pipistrellus  tasmaniensis</em> </p>
<p><strong>Description</strong> This is a <strong>large and robust bat</strong>. The <strong>fur is dark brown to reddish brown on the  back</strong> with and ventral fur is brown with pale tips.  The muzzle is sparsely haired. The <strong>slender  ears extend well above the head</strong> and overlap  when pressed together. There is a characteristic <strong>notch on the outer margin of the ear</strong> near the tip. The <strong>tragus is more  than half the length of the ear</strong>; it has a  moderate sized lobe at the rear base and narrows to a slightly rounded tip. <strong>The penis is hairy</strong>. There are <strong>two pairs of upper incisors</strong>: the  outer pair are very small and hard to see. There is <strong>a gap between the upper</strong> <strong>incisors and the canines</strong>. These features <strong>help to distinguish it from the greater  Broad-nosed Bat, </strong><strong><em>Scoteanax  rueppellii</em></strong><em>.</em> It differs from  the western False Pipistrelle, <em>F.  mackenziei</em> by being slightly smaller (greatest skull length  is 18.3 mm compared to 19.2 mm).</p>
<p><strong>Habitat</strong> In Tasmania and on the mainland they are found in wet sclerophyll and  coastal mallee. They prefer tall and wet forests where trees are over 20 m high  and the understorey is dense. They occur in open forests at lower altitudes. In  Queensland they have been captured within tall open forest, sub-tropical  riparian rainforest, cool-temperate rainforest and open forest with <em>E. acmenoides</em> and <em>E. tereticornis.</em></p>
<p><strong>Roost  Habits</strong> Eastern False Pipistrelles generally roost in  hollow trunks of eucalypt trees in colonies of 3 to 80. Colonies are usually  almost entirely male or female groups although evenly mixed colonies sometimes  occur. They have been recorded roosting in a cave at Jenolan, New South Wales  and they are occasionally found in old wooden buildings. In the Australian Alps  roost trees were exclusively older smooth-barked eucalypts. Most roosts  contained solitary bats, but one contained a colony of 79 males, 1 female and 3  white-striped Free-tailed bats <em>Austronomus  australis.</em> Radio tracked individuals changed roosts almost  every night, and returned to old roosts on different nights. Roosts on  consecutive nights were usually less than 750m apart although one bat moved 3.5  km between roosts. They have a home range of up to 136 ha. A banding study  showed a recaptured adult female was recaptured 88 km from its original banding  site 3 years earlier. One radio tracked bat  was found to move 12 kilometres from where it foraged to where it roosted in a  very large tree. </p>
<p><strong>Diet,  Flight and Foraging </strong>They tend to target the largest available prey  items. On the mainland they eat mainly moths, beetles (chaffer, weevil and rove  beetles) and some bugs, flies and ants. In Tasmania they eat mainly beetles  (75%), moths (10% and bugs (8%). Their flight is swift and direct, within or  just below the tree canopy. They tend to fly fast in a fixed horizontal plane  with sudden darting changes in course. They hunt in gaps and spaces within the  forest and avoid thick rainforest understorey or dense regrowth. They are absent  from small patches of remnant forest preferring continuous forest, where they  forage along tracks, creeks and rivers. They are also capable of moving through  cleared landscapes and have been recorded foraging in open areas.<br>

  <strong>Vocalisation  and Echolocation</strong><br>
  Characteristic  frequency between 35 and 39 kHz (n = 32). Curved and often steep without an up-  sweeping tail, occasionally tail down sweeping. Pre- characteristic section  often long. <br>
  Can be separated  from <em>Scotorepens greyii</em> and <em>Scotorepens sp.</em> (Parnaby, 1992) by  the lack of up-sweeping tail on most pulses. Easily confused with <em>S. orion</em> and <em>Scoteanax rueppellii</em>, however may be differentiated on length of  pre-characteristic section in some calls (Reinhold <em>et al.</em> 2001).</p>
