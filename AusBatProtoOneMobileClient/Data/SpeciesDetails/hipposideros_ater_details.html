  <em>Hipposideros  ater</em> <br>
Templeton, 1848</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Other  Names</strong> <em> Hipposideros  bicolor, </em>Dusky Horseshoe Bat. </p>
<p><strong>Description</strong> One of Australia&rsquo;s most delightful bats, the dusky Leaf-nosed Bat is  a <strong>small and delicate species</strong>. It differs from the fawn Leaf-nosed Bat, <em>H. cervinus,</em> in its <strong>small nose-leaf</strong> <strong>that lacks</strong> <strong>secondary leaflets</strong>. <strong>The ears are large, rounded and extend well beyond the top of the  head</strong>. <strong>Fur  long and very fluffy</strong> making the bat appear much larger than its 4 gm  mass. Fur <strong>colour is variable, usually pale grey-brown</strong> but interestingly in caves where it co-exists with the Orange  Diamond-faced Bat, <em>Rhinonicteris aurantia,</em> it takes on the same fur colour as that species, varying from orange  to white. The orange colour is likely due to bleaching in the high ammonia  atmosphere of the caves.</p>
<p><strong>Roost  Habits</strong> Dusky Leaf-nosed Bats roost hanging by their  toes from the ceiling with their wings and body free from the rock surface.  They hang at a distance of at least 10 to 20 cm from other individuals and do  not cluster. They roost primarily in relatively deep caves or disused mines but  have also been found in small overhangs, splits in escarpments, and boulder  piles. The most important feature of the roost is high temperature and  humidity. In the Northern Territory their roost microclimate averages 29oC and 92% relative humidity. Within the cave they select the warmest  and most humid sites available, showing a strong preference for avons that trap  warm air. In large caves they tend to select small side chambers and dead ends,  away from other species. Colony sizes vary from solitary bats to groups of 300 but  are commonly 10 to 30. A colony of 11 has been recorded roosting in a large  tree hollow in rainforest at McIlwraith Range on Cape York Peninsula. In the  Top End they often roost in the same caves the Orange Diamond-faced Bat, <em>Rhinonicteris aurantia</em> and have the  same fur colour, ranging from orange to yellow to white individuals. Ghost Bats, <em>Macroderma  gigas, </em>also commonly share their cave.  The small isolated colonies such as those at Cloncurry, Chillagoe, and  Blackdown Tablelands in Queensland and the Dulcie Ranges, in central Australia,  are dependent upon the presence of caves with unusually high humidity, enabling  these delicate bats to live in these arid inland environments.&nbsp; </p>
<p><strong>Habitat</strong> A wide variety of tropical habitats are used including rainforest,  monsoon forest, gallery forest, mangroves, Melaleuca swamps, scrubby open  forest, mixed open forest, open woodland, vine thickets, savanna woodland and  spinifex grasslands. </p>
<p><strong>Diet,  Flight and Foraging </strong>They are primarily continuous flight foragers,  capturing all of their prey while in flight or gleaning it from surfaces. They  do not use perch hunting. They fly below the canopy, frequently amongst dense  vegetation, in tall grass or close to the ground. Flight observation show that  they have a cruising speed of 10 to 12 km per hour but will fly much slower  when foraging, usually about 4 km/hr. They are also capable of hovering. Their  flight is slow irregular fluttering flight with occasional brief hovers and  glides. They are often less than 50 cm above the ground and rarely over 2 m  altitude. Several individuals may forage in close proximity where aerial  insects are abundant. Their fluttering flight is manoeuvrable but not agile.  They use a variety of turns from gentle horizontal turns, banking turns with  angles of less than 30o, skidding turns, and open wing-overs. Their slow flight means that  they do not travel far from their roost sites to forage. They tend to fly low  along walls and leave cave entrances cautiously, one at a time, following  contours around rocks, close to the ground and rapidly disappear into the  vegetation. This behaviour would help them to avoid predators such as Ghost  Bats hunting from the air and tree snakes hanging from cave walls and ceilings.  Studies in Queensland have shown them to consume almost entirely moths, 90% of  these were eared-moths (Noctuidae). The high frequency echolocation calls of  the bats are beyond the moths hearing range enabling the bats to hunt  eared-moths without them taking evasive action. In the Top End their diet is  less specialized, although moths still made up over 50% of the diet they also  eat beetles, termites, grasshoppers, ants, leaf-hoppers, mantis flies,  lacewings and mosquitos. They are a delightful companion in areas with high  numbers of mosquitos as they will circle you repeatedly, eating numerous  mosquitos on each pass until all are gone. They can easily detect monofilament  mist nets even in very cluttered habitats and will often flutter along the net  until they find a hole large enough to fly through. They don&rsquo;t always manage to  avoid nets; I once found a dead one caught in the web of a golden orb-weaving  spider. They can also evade capture from double-banked harp traps, and if  caught, can easily escape from the trap bag. Triple-banked traps are more  successful. They are very sensitive to dehydration and cannot be kept in  captivity for more than a couple of hours. Bat traps must be checked frequently,  and the bats released as soon as possible. </p>
<p><strong>Vocalisations  and Echolocation calls </strong> <em>H.ater</em> has a constant frequency search phase call type, much higher than any  other bat, 152 to 175kHz. The constant frequency echolocation technique  employed by the leaf-nosed bats allows them to detect the speed and direction  of very small flying insects with great accuracy. </p>
<p><strong>Notes</strong> This is a delicate species that dies readily in captivity and in  traps from dehydration and hypothermia. They have a constant frequency  echolocation call that varies from 175 kHz in the  Kimberley to 152 kHz in Queensland. </p>
