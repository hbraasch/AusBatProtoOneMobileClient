  <em>Hipposideros  cervinus </em><br>
(Gould, 1854)</p>
<p><strong>Other  Names</strong> <em>Hipposideros  galeritus, </em>Fawn Horseshoe Bat. </p>
<p><strong>Description</strong> Widespread and common in South-East Asia, this bat only just reaches the  northern tip of Australia. It is of medium size; forearm length averages 46.8  mm (45.0 to 47.8 mm) and weight of 7.0 g (5.6 to 8.4 g). The <strong>ears are broad and triangular</strong>. The <strong>nose leaf is small and comparatively simple</strong>, with <strong>two well-developed supplementary leaflets</strong> which project beyond the margin of the anterior leaf. The <strong>fur colour varies from grey to greyish-brown to orange</strong>. In <strong>males there is a small gland (the frontal  sac) behind the rear leaf</strong> of the nose leaf. This can  be extended or lowered at will by the bat and can exude a clear and apparently  odourless fluid. The function of these secretions is not known. The gland is  represented in females by a depression containing a tuft of hairs. </p>
<p><strong>Roost  Habits</strong> Fawn Leaf-nosed Bats roost in caves and mines in  colonies of up to 900 individuals, more commonly 20 to 100. Colonies in New  Guinea contain up to 60,000 bats in a single cave. Occasionally individuals are  found roosting in old sheds and buildings. They like warm and humid roost  conditions. One colony of 180 bats roosted in 26oC and 94% humidity. Like Dusky Leaf-nosed Bats, <em>H. ater</em>, they hang free from the  ceiling by their toes, often from only one foot, and space themselves 10 to 15  cm apart. They roost in small passages or avons rather than in large chambers.  They are always alert and fly readily when approached. When disturbed they hang  from the ceiling and pivot their body in an arc from side to side echolocating  while their ears are twitching rapidly. Larger males and reproductively active  females do not enter torpor. However small individuals or reproductively  inactive females enter torpor in response to cold temperature. The bats core  temperature drops in direct proportion to environmental temperature. This  species have a basic metabolic rate about 60% of that expected for its body  mass. They are thermoneutral in air temperatures of 31 to 35.oC. They are  commonly seen in the wet season around Iron Range but are infrequently caught  in the dry season. In the early 1980s&rsquo; there was a mine just to the south of  the town of Coen which contained an easily accessible population but this mine  collapsed and there have been no records of the species in the area since 1985.  (Sue Churchill notes).</p>
<p><strong>Habitat</strong> They occur from sea level to 1400 m where they are found in a variety  of habitats including rainforest, gallery forests along watercourses, and open  savannah woodland. They also forage around buildings and open parkland.</p>
<p><strong>Diet,  Flight and Foraging </strong>&nbsp;Fawn  Leaf-nosed Bats have a low metabolic rate, 58% of that expected for a mammal of  their weight. Perch hunting is metabolically efficient compared to aerial  foraging and is the main technique used by these bats in Papua New Guinea. They  select perches near an open space and 1 to 6 m above the ground. Many different  perches are used during the night and they return to the perch to eat captured  prey discarding wings and unpalatable parts. In Queensland they perch hunt only  15% of the time, prey usually being captured by aerial pursuit and by surface  gleaning. When foraging the flight is slow and fluttery, close to vegetation,  from 1 m above the ground to just below the canopy. By contrast the flight when  commuting is fast and direct, with slight changes of direction to avoid  vegetation. They commute from roosting to foraging areas along established  pathways, often creeks or gullies. Individuals or groups split off from the  main group and fly into the forest to commence hunting and the return to the  roost is a reverse pattern of the exit. They eat mainly moths and beetles with  occasional bugs, cockroaches, flies and parasitic wasps. </p>
