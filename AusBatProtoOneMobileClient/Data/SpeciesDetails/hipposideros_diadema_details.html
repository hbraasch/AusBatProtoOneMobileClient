  <em>Hipposideros  diadema </em><br>
(Geoffroy, 1813)</p>
<p><strong>Other  Names</strong> Diadem Horseshoe Bat. </p>
<p><strong>Description</strong> A formidable bat, this is the <strong>largest </strong>Leaf-nosed bat in Australia, forearm length averages 81.8 mm (77.5 to 85.1 mm) and  weight averages 43.9 g (32.0 to 57.0 g). The fur on the back is a<strong> pale grey to light brown </strong>(there is also a  deep burgundy red form) with a <strong>distinct  white patch on each shoulder.</strong> The <strong>ears are of long </strong>being broad at  the base and <strong>acutely pointed.</strong> The <strong>nose leaf is well developed</strong>, with <strong>three or</strong> <strong>four lateral supplementary leaflets</strong>, the fourth is small and sometimes rudimentary. There is <strong>no frontal sac</strong>. </p>
<p><strong>Roost  Habits</strong> Diadem Leaf-nosed Bats are most commonly found  in caves and disused mines, but also in buildings and road culverts. They show  a preference for large caves with large chambers and multiple entrances. I have  recorded roost microclimates of 25 to 26.5oC and 65 to 80% humidity. They usually  hang from the ceiling by their toes, their wings folded at their sides and  separated from each other by 20 to 25 cm. A study at Chillagoe caves showed  they used 9 of the 18 suitable caves. Colony sizes ranged from 1 to 65, usually  less than 10 with many solitary males. In September 1981 I found 2000 of these  bats in Gordon&rsquo;s Mine at Iron Range. At this density the bats roosted close  together, across the ceiling and down the wall of a section of passage to  within 30 cm of the floor. More recently the colony has ranged from 70 to 250  with 100 being typical. In New Guinea they roost singly or in small groups  during much of the year but form large maternity colonies in caves when giving  birth and nursing young. Queensland Diadem Leaf-nosed Bats can effectively  thermoregulate at temperatures as low as 9oC. but their thermal-neutral zone is at 29 oC to 34 oC. At 29oC their body  temperature is 34.9oC and they can  drop their body temperature down to 33.0 oC. They do not enter torpor. Their basal metabolic rate is 33.0 cm3 O2-h-1, with a minimal  conductance 5.51 cm3 O2-h-1oC. Low basal rates of metabolism are consistent with perch hunting  behaviour which is characterized by intermittent flight and long periods of  rest, saving considerable energy. They have a basal metabolic rate that  averaged 75% of those bats that used continuous flight.</p>
<p><strong>Habitat </strong>Diadem Leaf-nosed Bats use a variety of habitats  from lowland rainforest, <em>Melaleuca</em> forests, eucalypt woodland, and deciduous vine thicket to open  woodland. </p>
<p><strong>Diet,  Flight and Foraging </strong>These large bats are occasional carnivores.  Recent work has found the remains of birds in their scats. Their more usual  diet is large hard bodied insects such as beetles and grasshoppers, as well as  large moths, bugs, and wasps. A light-tagging study of these bats at Chillagoe  showed that they exit from their cave soon after dusk and fly directly to  regularly used individual foraging areas usually within 2 to 10 kilometres of  the cave. At the foraging area they hunted from perches that were 5 to 15 m  above the ground. While hanging from the perch the bat twists continuously from  side to side, with ears twitching constantly while echolocating to locate prey.  When prey is detected, they drop from the perch, catch the prey with their  mouth and fly back to the perch before eating it. If a swarm of insects appear  the bats remain on the wing to catch several, temporarily storing them in cheek  pockets before returning to the perch. Foraging flights have been observed at  the edge of vegetation, in small clearings, and in open woodland. They spend  between two and seven hours foraging each night usually in two activity peaks  and spent the remainder of the time roosting in caves. Average foraging range  was 1 km. They often continue foraging for to up to an hour after first light.  They have large cheek pouches for temporarily holding food while they are in  flight. They have long wings and a high wing loading like the carnivorous Ghost  Bat, <em>Macroderma gigas</em>. They have been recorded killing bats, one killed a Least Blossom  Bat, <em>Macroglossus minimus</em> that was caught in a Bat Trap. They are also known to consume other  bats in captivity.</p>
<p><strong>Notes</strong> They have a formidable set of teeth, strong jaws for crunching  beetles and an unpleasant and tenacious disposition when being removed from a  mist net. Bites to the fingers are a memorable experience. Heavy gloves are  strongly recommended. They readily quieten down in captivity. Jenny Mclean at  the Tolga Bat Hospital has cared for a beautiful female (who has a damaged  wing) for many years. She is very tame but quite an aristocrat and goes by the  name of &ldquo;Lady Di&rdquo;</p>
