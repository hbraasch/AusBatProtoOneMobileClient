  <em>Hipposideros  inornatus </em><br>
McKean, 1970</p>
<p><strong>Other  Names</strong> <em>Hipposideros  diadema inornatus</em>, Diadem Horseshoe Bat (part). Diadem Leaf-nosed  Bat (part)</p>
<p><strong>Description</strong> A rare bat that is better natured than its cousin, the Queensland  Diadem Leaf-nosed Bat, <em>H. diadema. </em>The Arnhem Leaf-nosed Bat is <strong>distinctly  smaller with a forearm of 68.1 to 73.4 mm and lacks the white fur patches at  the shoulders</strong>. The <strong>fur on  the back is pale brown with slightly darker tips</strong> and is only <strong>slightly paler on the belly</strong>. Bright orange individuals have also been recorded. </p>
<p><strong>Roost  Habits </strong>This species is known from only a few large  sandstone caves with multiple entrances. These are characteristically draughty,  cool (23 to 25oC and 75 to 85%  humidity), and close to water. They have recently been recorded from a large,  abandoned mine in Kakadu National Park. In 1989 I (S.C.) located 2 cave  colonies. One at Mt Callanan, in Kakadu National Park, where a colony of 14  adults and 8 young were roosting about 25 cm apart in a cool area of the cave,  under large boulders, 1 metre above the floor and only a few metres from a  small stream running through the cave. In the other colony, at Dinner Creek  near Oenpelli up to 15 of these bats roosted in similar conditions in a large  sandstone cave. Over a number of years, I (S.C.) have revisited a colony in a  sandstone cave with a collapsed roof at Tolmer Falls, in Litchfield National  Park. The cave is cool and draughty and has a small spring running through it.  This colony roosted 3 m above the ground. It had contained 15 individuals in  1978, 8 in 1984 and none during multiple trips from from 1987 to 1995.</p>
<p><strong>Habitat</strong> &nbsp;Monsoon forest, tall open  forest, sandstone monsoon forest, open woodland as well as open heath on the  sandstone plateau. Found only in sandstone escarpment areas close to water. </p>
<p><strong>Diet,  Flight and Foraging </strong>&nbsp;At Deaf  Adder Gorge in Kakadu National Park, a large number of these bats (92) flew  through my (S.C.) campsite one evening. The bats were flying along the edge of  the creek through thick riverine monsoon forest, and many could be heard  chewing and crunching as they flew past. While eating they flew straight with a  gliding flight. When not eating they had a fast and zigzagged flight. They flew  well below the canopy at between 1 and 3 m above the ground. They were flying  fast and moving quickly downstream presumably so they could spread out to  forage once outside the confines of the gorge. Many were captured the following  evening by placing mist nets in the forest. Stomach contents have been found to  consist mostly of beetles (78%), with some moths (20%) and traces of  cockroaches and leafhoppers. </p>
<p><strong>Vocalisations  and Echolocation calls </strong><br>
  The largest  leaf-nosed bat in the Top End it has a much lower characteristic frequency than  the other Leaf-nosed Bats (67.1 to 71.2 kHz). The distance over which calls of  this species can be detected is estimated at around 10 m so it is easily  recorded with ultrasound detectors. </p>
