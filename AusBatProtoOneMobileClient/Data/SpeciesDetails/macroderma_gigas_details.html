<body style='background-color: transparent;'><p><strong>Australian  Ghost Bat</strong><br>
  <em>Macroderma  gigas </em><br>
(Dobson, 1880)</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Other  Names</strong> <em>Megaderma  gigas</em>, Ghost False Vampire, False Vampire, Australian  False Vampire. </p>
<p><strong>Distribution </strong>Once distributed across most of inland and  northern Australia as far south as the Flinders Ranges in SA. Recorded until  1970 in central Australia but now restricted to tropical northern Australia.  Endemic to Australia. Macroderma gigas also appears to be  widespread and common on the coastal islands of the Kimberley and Top End although it hasn&rsquo;t been recorded  from the Tiwi Islands. </p>
<p><strong>Description </strong>A spectacular bat, this is <strong>largest echolocating bat in Australia</strong> and one of the largest in the world. It has <strong>pale grey or light brown fur with a lighter belly. </strong>Individuals tend to be paler, almost white, in more inland  populations. The wing membranes are pale cream to brown. It has <strong>no tail</strong> but retains a full tail membrane. The <strong>very large ears</strong> are <strong>joined above the head</strong> and there is a <strong>large forked tragus</strong>. It has <strong>large eyes</strong> and a <strong>long simple shaped nose-leaf</strong> extends  along the top of the muzzle. </p>
<p><strong>Roost  Habits</strong> Ghost Bats roost in shallow sandstone caves  along cliff lines, under boulder piles, in deep limestone caves and in  abandoned mines. They have a preference in the Top End for caves with roost  microclimates of 27 to 29oC and 80% relative humidity.  They roost either individually or in colonies of 30 to 200, with one colony of  over 1500. Ghost Bats cannot lower their body  temperature and enter torpor, so they must find roost sites with temperatures  above 23C in order to conserve energy. These bats  commonly roost hanging from the ceiling about 25 cm apart but they roost more  closely when they have young. The females congregate in maternity roosts, these  are usually in larger caves and mines but I have also found small groups of  females with young roosting in boulder piles and shallow escarpment overhangs.  Females show a strong preference for remaining in the area they were born  whereas males tend to move more readily to different areas. When leaving the  roost to forage, pregnant females leave the cave first. They are trapped  consistently earlier than non-pregnant females and adult males. Ghost Bats are  sensitive to roost disturbance, particularly when they have young. The young  are sometimes dislodged during rapid take-offs and the adults may abandon the  roost site. Cave searches along cliff lines can inadvertently flush individuals  out into the daylight where they are taken by birds of prey. Many other bat  species have been found roosting in the same caves as Ghost bats but they  usually roost in a different part of the cave. Ghost bats share a roost at  certain times of the year with a colony of over 20,000 Orange Diamond-faced  Bat, <em>Rhinonicteris aurantia</em>, at Tolmer Falls, in the Northern Territory, but they roost in the  areas that are inaccessible to Ghost Bats.</p>
<p><strong>Habitat</strong> Ghost Bats occur in a broad range of habitats including arid spinifex  hillsides, black soil grasslands, monsoon forest, open savannah woodland, tall  open forest, deciduous vine forest and tropical rainforest and agricultural  areas. In areas of denser vegetation they follow creek lines and select  clearings for hunting. Their distribution is influenced by the availability of  suitable caves and mines for roost sites. </p>
<p><strong>Diet,  Flight and Foraging&nbsp; </strong>They eat a wide range of dietary items from large invertebrates to  birds, bats, small marsupials and rodents, frogs, lizards and geckoes. More  than 50 bird species have been recorded as prey, these are almost all small  diurnal species (less than 33g) that either aggregate to roost, such as  Budgerigars,<em> Melopsittacus undulatus </em>or are ground dwelling, like Little Buttonquail, <em>Turnix velox</em>..They are  capable of taking prey up to the size of Grey-crowned Bablers, <em>Pomatostomus temporalis </em>(over 65 g.)</p>
<p>I (S.C.) have  watched them repeatedly catch cave bats (mainly Orange Diamond-faced Bats, <em>Rhinonicteris aurantia</em>, on the wing as  they leave the roost at dusk, swooping down on them from behind. They are known  to feed on over 13 species of bats from small cave dwelling species such as  Dusky Leaf-nosed Bats, <em>Hipposideros  ater</em> to Common Sheath-tailed Bats, <em>Taphozous georgianus</em> and forest  dwelling species such as Gould&rsquo;s Wattled Bat, <em>Chalinolobus  gouldii</em> and White-striped Free-tailed Bats, <em>Austronomus australis. </em>They commonly  eat large invertebrates particularly locusts and beetles, but also centipedes,  millipedes, spiders, cockroaches, moths, caterpillars, cicadas and even small  prey such as ants and termites. <br>
  When feeding on  small ground dwelling mammals and birds they drop onto them from above and wrap  them in their wings, biting them repeatedly on the head. They then hold them by  the head and crawl backwards to a tree, climbing the tree with their hind feet  until they have gained enough height to fly to a perch before consuming it.  They eat their prey headfirst often holding it with their thumb claws,  discarding beaks, jaws, wings, legs and tails. Their distinctive claw marks can  be seen commonly on the smooth white bark of the Poplar Gum, <em>Eucalyptus alba</em>, at Pine Creek  where Ghost Bats are common. The same distinctive scratches are found in the  caves where they roost. They often return to their cave roost to eat their  food, although this may only be with their final prey for the hunt. Smaller  prey are more likely to be eaten at the perch. On Groote Eylandt they were  captured in pit traps where they had entered and eaten several of the rare  Northern Hopping Mice, <em>Notomys  aquillo</em>, that were being studied. There is evidence of  Ghost Bats preying upon cane toads in Kakadu National Park, bats have been  found dead with chewed cane toads in their throats. <br>
  Ghost Bats use  several techniques for catching prey: active aerial hunting with echolocation;  gleaning the ground or other surfaces while in flight using echolocation; perch  hunting to ambush passing prey both on the ground and in the air using  echolocation and perch hunting by passively detecting prey using eyesight  and/or quietly listening for noises, made by prey, without the use of echolocation.  Radio-tracking studies have shown they forage about 2 kms (up to 12 kms at Mt  Etna) from the roost cave, and use the same foraging areas (about 60 ha) each  night. Within this area the bats hunted from tree perches, moving to a new  vantage point every 15 minutes. Foraging areas were not exclusive and up to 20  bats had overlapping ranges. This perch hunting technique is an effective way  to conserve energy.</p>
<p><strong>Flight</strong> When hunting they have a gently curving, sinuous, moderate-speed  flight. They weave between the trees in open woodland, often gliding and their  wingbeats are very quiet. While foraging they fly at about 2 to 3 m above the  ground, over shrubs and tall grass. Flying from perch to perch and staying for  5 to 20 minutes. Their agility is high; they can make coordinated turns of more  than 60o and  asymmetrical turns using skidding turns, open wingover and tight wingovers.  When commuting they usually fly below 10 m. Flight speeds of 25 km/hr have been  recorded. Ghost Bats have the highest wing loading of all the surface gleaning  species and consequently needs a higher flight speed to generate sufficient  lift even for level flight. In open areas of grassland they often become  entangled in barbed wire fences. As their flight is usually just above the vegetation  and they often fly without echolocating, they are particularly vulnerable to  new fences.</p>
<p><strong>&nbsp;</strong><strong>Vocalisations  and Echolocation calls s and vocalisations </strong>Ghost Bats make  a broad range of calls that are within human hearing consisting of&nbsp; distinctive chitters, chirps and trills, they  make these calls when disturbed at the roost, or when they are getting active  before they leave the cave at dusk. These calls can also be heard throughout  the forest at night. The calls shown here are courtesy of Nicola Hanrahan. <br>
Ghost Bats have  among the most sensitive hearing measured among bats. Their large ears amplify  sounds up to 30 dB, especially in frequencies of 4 to 10 kHz, which would help  them to readily detect sounds created by their prey. </p>
