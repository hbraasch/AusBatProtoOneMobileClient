<body style='background-color: transparent;'><p><strong>Least  Blossom Bat</strong><br>
  <em>Macroglossus  minimus </em><br>
(Geoffroy, 1810)</p>
<p><strong>Other  names</strong> <em>Macroglossus  lagochilus, </em>Lesser Long-tongued Blossom Bat and Northern Blossom Bat</p>
<p><strong>Description</strong> This is the smallest species of Fruit Bat in the world. Like a <strong>miniature Flying Fox</strong> with <strong>long pointed muzzle</strong> and <strong>very long brush-tipped tongue</strong>. The fur  is a uniform <strong>light reddish brown</strong>, slightly paler on the belly. There is a claw on the second digit of  the wing. They are small with a forearm of 40.0 (38.1 to 43.0) mm and weight of  12.8 (10.5 to 19.5) grams. </p>
<p><strong>Roost  Habits</strong> They roost alone or in mother infant pairs or  small well spaced groups of 2 to 3. They roost with their wings wrapped around  them and look like a cluster of dead leaves. the illusion is enhanced by the  bats habit of occasionally rocking from side to side as if the wind has  disturbed them. They do not move far between roosts but change roosts  frequently. They commonly roost on the underside of large leaves (living or dead),  under tree branches, in tree hollows, under loose bark, amongst thick foliage,  in bamboo thickets, or in palm fronds. They have also been reported to roost in  the rolled up leaves of bananas and under the eaves of abandoned huts. At the  day roost they can enter shallow torpor. Their body temperature decreasing as  they rest. Their temperature also decreases with reduced ambient temperature.  When foraging their metabolic rate is twice the resting rate and although they  live in the tropics they enter torpor for several hours every day. This drops  their energy expenditure to 60 to 80% of a normal resting rate. Least Blossom  Bats have a lower metabolic rate than expected for a mammal of their weight. <strong>Habitat</strong> They have been found from sea level to 2250m  with densities decreasing at higher altitudes. They show a preference for any  habitat with large flowers for them to feed on. In Australia that is  predominantly rainforest, monsoon forest, mangroves, paperbark swamps, bamboo  thickets and riverine vegetation. They can also be found in eucalypt woodlands  adjacent to these habitats.</p>
<p><strong>Diet,  Flight and Foraging </strong>&nbsp;Least  Blossom Bats use their large eyes and keen sense of smell to find flowers in  the forest at night to to feed on nectar and pollen. They collect nectar with  long tongues with rows of modified lingual papillae at the tip that act as a  nectar-absorbing mop. They feed on heavily flowering Paperbarks <em>Melaleuca&nbsp; </em>(particularly the night-flowering <em>Melaleuca  cajuputi</em>) and Satinash <em>Syzygium </em>trees, Mangroves (particularly <em>Sonneratia</em>), and they are inordinately  fond of Banana <em>Musa</em> flowers  (a favourite throughout their range). Other food items include flowering  Coconut Palms, Freshwater Mangroves <em>Barringtonia</em> and Bottlebrush <em>Callistemon</em>. Feeds actively upon two introduced plants, the Sausage Tree <em>Kigelia pinnata</em>, and the  Century Plant <em>Agave americana</em> both of which are pollinated by bats in their countries of origin.  These bats are capable of briefly hovering in front of a flower but they  usually crash land and hang sprawled across the flower to feed. Their fur  becomes covered in pollen in the process. The hairs are modified with rough  scales to catch the pollen which is later groomed off and eaten. Pollen is the  major source of protein and nectar provides them with energy. They do eat some  fruit, such as Figs <em>Ficus spp, </em>Climbing Pandan<em> Freycinetia  spp</em> and Timon <em>Timonius</em> species. These bats can swallow quite large seeds in comparison to  their body size and are important pollinators and seed dispersers. Fruits  appear to contribute more to their diet in New Guinea than they are in  Australia. They also eat leaves and insects commonly are found in their faeces  but these are not in high enough numbers to make any significant contribution  to their diet. They forage from near ground level well into the sub-canopy.  Least Blossom Bats will travel considerable distances for food. In the  Philippines there is evidence of them flying between islands. They forage  throughout the night. In New Guinea adults hold an exclusive home range of  about 6 ha (1.9 to 15.1 ha) with core areas around food plants of 1.5 ha  whereas sub-adults usually have overlapping ranges. Adults appear to defend  their food resources from other bats by chasing the intruder, vocalising loudly  and wing clapping. <br>
  One hot, humid  night near Darwin, while mist netting in monsoon forest, a Least Blossom Bat  hovered repeatedly around my head (SC). It then landed on top of my head and  licked the salty sweat from my forehead and face, returning several times for  more over the next ten minutes. </p>
<p><strong>Notes</strong> These bats have a fast metabolism and burn up energy quickly.  Captured bats should be released promptly as they rapidly become low on energy  and enter torpor. I (S.C.) have found that feeding them a concentrated sugar  and water syrup from a teaspoon gives them enough energy to get going again. It  also creates an opportunity to watch their long tongue in action. When captured  in mist nets Least Blossom Bats usually remain silent and are relatively easily  removed from the net. Southern Blossom Bats, <em>Syconycteris  australis</em>, are completely different and will scream loudly  and plaintively while struggling. Damian Milne tells me that Least Blossom Bats  make a distinctive metallic call that can be heard at night in backyard gardens  of Darwin. They have a strong eye shine and can easily been seen when  spotlighting.</p>
