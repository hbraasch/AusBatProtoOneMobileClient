  <em>Micronomus  norfolkensis </em><br>
(Gray, 1839)</p>
<p><strong>Other  Names</strong> <em>Mormopterus  (Micronomus) norfolkensis,</em> <em>Mormopterus norfolkensis, Tadarida norfolkensis</em> <em>Tadarida norfolcensis, Nyctinomus  norfolkensis, Molossus norfolkensis, </em>Norfolk Island  Free-tailed Bat.</p>
<p><strong>Description</strong> A <strong>small  species</strong>, the forearm length is 35.7  &ndash; 38.6 mm, with a weight of 6.8 to 10.5 g. The fur on the back is dark  brown to reddish brown with the bases cream. The fur on the belly is slightly  paler, tricoloured, mainly grey-brown with the tips and bases cream. The ears  are triangular, not joined, shorter than the head and being separated by a  small patch of fur and. The muzzle is small, tapered to the nostrils, thus  differing from <em>Ozimops</em> species  where the muzzle is swollen. From the lateral view, the head profile is  sinuate, with an elevated braincase and is unlike the flattened and straight  profile found in most of the <em>Ozimops</em> species. There is no throat pouch, (previous reports are incorrect).  Both <strong>males</strong> and <strong>females</strong> possess a <strong>long  finger-like genital projection. The genital projection is a very useful  diagnostic key in the field. </strong> </p>
<p><strong>Roost  Habits</strong> They roost in tree hollows, usually in hollow  spouts of large mature trees but there are also several records from buildings.  Two males were collected from the wall cavity of a house sharing the roost with  eastern Horseshoe Bats,<em> Rhinolophus  megaphyllus</em> and a Broad-nosed Bat, <em>Scotorepens</em> sp. Another was roosting in  the roof of a hut with an eastern Broad-nosed Bat, <em>Scotorepens orion,</em> and several  Gould's Wattled Bats <em>Chalinolobus gouldii</em>. They have been collected from under the metal cap on the top of  telegraph poles and under exfoliating bark on trees.&nbsp; They will also roost in bat boxes, and a  colony in New South Wales has used the same bat boxes for over 5 years. A  pregnant female is reported to have roosted in a telegraph pole in the full sun;  a site that it shared with 8 others.</p>
<p>A recent study also  identified Grey Mangroves, <em>Avicennia  marina</em>, being used as roosts where they were found in hollows  in live trees, but also in dead stags. They have also been found in Swamp Oak, <em>Casuarina glauca</em>. The study also  found that lactating females switched roosts often, but showed high patch  fidelity, with all bats roosting within 1 km of where they were captured and  relatively close to their previous roosts (less than 150m). Radio tracking  found that bats foraged up to 10 km away from their roosts each night. Other  studies have identified them travelling shorter distances; up to 2 km in the  Hunter Valley NSW, and up to 5 km at Urbenville in NSW.</p>
<p><strong>Habitat</strong> Most records are from dry eucalypt forest and woodland on the coastal  side of the Great Dividing Range. Usually only solitary bats are captured, but  one group was caught flying low over a rocky river in rainforest and wet  sclerophyll forest. They show a preference for open spaces in woodland or forest  and are more active in the upper slopes of forest areas rather than in riparian  zones. They forage more commonly over larger rather than small waterways. </p>
<p><strong>Vocalisations  and Echolocation calls . </strong>The search phase  echolocation call is very variable, but usually comprises short duration pulses  of 2&ndash;4 msec., usually of constant frequency but can be frequency modulated or  slightly dome shaped and in the range of 30&ndash;35kHz. Many calls have alternating  frequency pulses, the lower pulse anywhere between 1 and 4kHz displaced from  the upper pulse. Even though the calls are variable, alternating frequency  pulse calls are not known from any other Australian molossid species, thus  making calls of M. norfolkensis readily identifiable. </p>
