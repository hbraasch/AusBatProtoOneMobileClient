<body style='background-color: transparent;'><p><strong>Little  Long-fingered Bat</strong><br>
  <em>Miniopterus  australis </em><br>
(Tomes, 1858)</p>
<p><strong>Other  Names</strong> Little Bent-wing Bat, Little Bent-winged Bat,  Little Bentwing Bat</p>
<p><strong>Description:</strong> The little Long-fingered bat has a uniform <strong>dark chocolate brown fur on back</strong>, slightly <strong>lighter on belly</strong>. They occasionally have reddish fur due to ammonia bleaching in large  nursery caves. Distinctly <strong>short muzzle and  domed head</strong>. The <strong>ears  are short, rounded </strong>and roughly triangular. The last phalanx on the  third finger of the wing is about three times the length of the middle phalanx,  giving a <strong>bent wing appearance</strong>. The last phalanx is folded back along the first phalanx when the bat  is at rest. This is the smallest Long-fingered bat, with a forearm of 37.3 to  40.8 mm.</p>
<p><strong>Roost  Habits</strong> These are cave-dwelling bats that congregate in  the summer months into maternity colonies and disperse during the winter. The  few documented maternity sites are normally situated in limestone cave systems.  There is a huge maternity colony of 100,000 adult bats at Mt Etna caves, in  central Queensland. They are known to roost in caves, abandoned mines, tunnels,  stormwater drains, occasionally buildings and they have even been reported to  roost in banana trees within a plantation. In November a colony of 30 bats was  found roosting in a crevice in a hollow of a large rainforest tree <em>Citronella moorei</em> in northern New  South Wales. Conditions inside the tree hollow were 21oC and 81% humidity (cooler and more humid than  outside). It appeared to be used only as an occasional roost and the 3 bats  captured were males. They have been found from sea level to about 1,500 m  elevation.</p>
<p><strong>Habitat</strong> Little Long-fingered bats show a preference for well timbered areas  including rainforest, vine thicket, wet and dry sclerophyll forests, <em>Melaleuca</em> swamps and coastal forests. </p>
<p><strong>Diet,  Flight and Foraging </strong>This species is an aerial hawker, foraging mainly  in open spaces. These bats have a relatively low wing loading allowing them to  fly rapidly and with considerable maneuverability between shrub and canopy  layers of densely wooded areas. Flight speeds of up to 25 km per hour have been  recorded. In the Richmond Range in New South Wales their diet contained mostly  beetles, moths and flies but also a surprisingly high proportion of spiders  (30% of scats contained spiders). Elsewhere they additionally have been  reported to eat crane flies, ants and wasps.</p>
<p><strong>Vocalisations and Echolocation calls</strong></p>
<p>Characteristic  frequency 54.5 to 64.5 kHz (n = 53). This species is known to exhibit some  variation in call characteristics over its range, calling at lower frequencies  (56 to 56.5 kHz) in north Queensland (Reinhold <em>et al.</em> 2001). <br>
  The  call is curved, usually with down-sweeping tail and has a higher characteristic  frequency than any other species with curved pulses. </p>
