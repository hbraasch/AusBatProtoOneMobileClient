  <em>Miniopterus  orianae bassanii </em><br>
(Cardinal and  Christidis, 2000)</p>
<p><strong>Other  Names</strong><em> Miniopterus schreibersii, </em>Southern Bent-winged Bat, Common Bent-winged Bat (part), Common  Bentwing Bat (part). We have adopted the name &lsquo;long-fingered&rsquo; as a preferred  common name to be consistent with the common names of other overseas species. </p>
<p>There are three  subspecies of the Australian Long-fingered Bat, <em>Miniopterus orianae</em>. Further  taxonomic assessment is underway, and it is likely that the three sub-species  will be eventually upgraded to full species. In the meantime we are using a  separate account for each sub-species to avoid confusing what we know about  these bats. </p>
<p><strong>Description</strong> This bat has dark <strong>reddish brown to  dark brown fur on its back</strong>, slightly lighter on belly.  It has a distinctly <strong>short muzzle and domed head</strong>. The ears are short, rounded and roughly triangular. The last phalanx  on the third finger of the wing is about three times the length of the middle  phalanx, giving a <strong>bent wing appearance</strong>. The last phalanx is folded back along the first phalanx when the bat  is at rest. The three sub-species of <em>M.  orianae</em> are very similar but differ genetically and form  separate maternity colonies. The Southern Long-fingered <strong>cannot</strong> be identified from the  East Australian Long-fingered Bats. DNA analysis is required for  identification in the species overlap zone in western Victoria.</p>
<p><strong>Roost  Habits</strong> This subspecies is an obligate cave dweller but  also use man made constructions such as mine adits and road culverts. They form  discrete populations centred on a maternity cave that is used annually for the  birth and development of young. Only two maternity caves are known for the  southern Long-fingered bat. Both males and females congregate in many thousands  in a dome shaped chamber of the cave. The large numbers of bats roosting  together generates a lot of body heat which is trapped in the dome roof. It is  in these pockets of warm and humid air that the young are born and reared. The  bats&rsquo; combined body heat can raise the cave temperature by up to 12oC. Each population disperses to other caves from  April to August but only within its specific territorial range. Movement  between territories is unusual. Over 50 caves are known to be used as wintering  sites. Winter caves need to be cold enough to keep their body temperature low,  to reduce their metabolic rate and prolong the fat reserves built up during the  summer. </p>
<p><strong>Habitat</strong> They are associated primarily with woodlands near large natural  wetlands, river basins and agricultural areas. </p>
<p><strong>Diet,  Flight and Foraging </strong>&nbsp;Moths make  up the major part of the diet. Where there are trees this species flies high,  from just above the canopy to many times canopy height. In more open areas such  as grasslands, flight may be within 6 m of the ground. Flight is very fast and  relatively level with swift, shallow dives. They can forage long distances from  the roost site.</p>
<p><strong>Activity  and Movements </strong><br>
  Extensive  banding studies were undertaken by Peter Dywer in the 1960s, and there are  several records of individuals moving between the Warrnambool/Naracoorte  population and sites north-east of Melbourne and in south-east NSW within the  range of the Eastern Bent-wing Bat. The longest movement recorded was of an  adult male banded in 1963 in north-east NSW and recaptured in 1965 at a cave at  Panmure, near Warrnambool, a distance of 1300 km. As there are very few of  these long distance records compared to the number of recaptures within the  normal range, it is assumed that these are not typical but represent vagrant or  possibly human assisted movements. The development of field techniques to  distinguish between the Southern and Eastern subspecies would assist in  determining the distribution of the Southern Bent-wing Bat. Non-genetic  techniques could include morphometric or echolocation call differences, as the  two subspecies have been shown to call at different frequencies. </p>
<p><strong>Echolocation </strong>Vocalisations and Echolocation calls s for the  three sub-species of <em>M. orianae</em> differ from each other. The southern Long-fingered bat <em>M. o. </em><em>bassanii </em>has a mean frequency of 47.7 kHz. </p>
