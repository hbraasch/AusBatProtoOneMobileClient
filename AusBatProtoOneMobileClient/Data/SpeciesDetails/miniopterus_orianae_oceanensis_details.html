<body style='background-color: transparent;'><p><strong>East  Australian Long-fingered Bat</strong><br>
  <em>Miniopterus  orianae oceanensis </em><br>
Maeda, 1982</p>
<p><strong>Other  Names</strong> <em>Miniopterus  schreibersii</em>, Eastern Bent-winged Bat, Common Bent-winged Bat  (part), Common Bentwing Bat (part).</p>
<p><strong>Description</strong> This bat has <strong>dark reddish brown  to dark brown fur</strong> <strong>on its  back</strong>, slightly lighter on belly. A reddish colour  form is known from Queensland. It has a distinctly <strong>short muzzle</strong> <strong>and</strong> <strong>domed  head</strong>. The ears are short, rounded and roughly  triangular. The last phalanx on the third finger of the wing is about three  times the length of the middle phalanx, giving a <strong>bent wing appearance</strong>. The last  phalanx is folded back along the first phalanx when the bat is at rest.</p>
<p><strong>Roost  Habits</strong> East Australian Long-fingered <strong>Bats</strong> are cave dwellers but also use man made structures  such as abandoned mines and road culverts. Populations are centred on maternity  caves that are used annually for the birth and development of young. Each  population disperses to other caves during the year but only within its own  territorial range. Movement between territories is unusual, although one bat is  recorded to have moved 1,300 kms. In the southern Australian winter these bats  select hibernation caves that are cold enough to keep their body temperature  low, to reduce their metabolic rate and prolong fat reserves built up during  the summer. In the tropical &quot;winter&quot; they remain active and forage  nightly, selecting roost caves of moderate temperatures. </p>
<p><strong>Habitat</strong> They occur is a broad range of habitats including rainforest, wet and  dry sclerophyll forest, monsoon forest, open woodland, paperbark forests and  open grasslands.&nbsp; </p>
<p><strong>Diet,  Flight and Foraging </strong>&nbsp;At  Richmond Range in New South Wales moths were the dominant prey item with a few  flies, cockroaches and beetles. In forested areas this species flies high, from  just above the canopy to many times canopy height. In more open areas such as  grasslands, flight may be within 6m of the ground. Flight is very fast and  typically relatively level with swift shallow dives. They can forage long  distances from the roost site and several marked females have travelled up to  65 km in one night. </p>
<p><strong>Vocalisations  and Echolocation Calls</strong></p>
<p>The  characteristic frequency is 43 to 48 kHz (n = 72). Curved, often with  down-sweeping tail. Characteristic section may be long in search phase. Pulse  shape and time between calls usually variable within a sequence. </p>
