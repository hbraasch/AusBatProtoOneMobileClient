<body style='background-color: transparent;'><p><strong>North  Australian Long-fingered Bat</strong><br>
  <em>Miniopterus  orianae orianae</em><br>
Thomas, 1922 </p>
<p><strong>Other  Names</strong> <em>Miniopterus  schreibersii,</em> Southern Bent-winged Bat, Common Bent-winged Bat  (part), Common Bentwing Bat (part).</p>
<p><strong>Description</strong> This bat has <strong>dark reddish brown  to dark brown fur on its back</strong>, slightly  lighter on belly. It has a distinctly <strong>short  muzzle and domed head</strong>. The ears are short, rounded and roughly triangular.  The last phalanx on the third finger of the wing is about three times the  length of the middle phalanx, giving a <strong>bent  wing appearance</strong>. The last phalanx is folded back along the first  phalanx when the bat is at rest. </p>
<p><strong>Roost  Habits </strong>North Australian Long-fingered Bats roost in a  variety of caves and mines from shallow sandstone overhangs to complex limestone  labyrinths, abandoned mines, road culverts, storm  water drains and bridges as well as buildings. From April to August in  the tropical &quot;winter&quot; bats do not hibernate, instead they remain  active and forage nightly, selecting roost caves of moderate temperatures (26.5oC) and high  humidity (95%). This choice of roost microclimate enables them to maintain  water balance at minimum metabolic cost. They usually roost clinging to the  walls in large clusters in close contact with each other.&nbsp; </p>
<p><strong>Habitat </strong>They use a broad range of habitats including  rainforest, wet and dry sclerophyll forest, monsoon forest, open woodland,  paperbark forests and open grasslands. They are  usually associated with rocky hills and escarpments.</p>
<p><strong>Diet,  Flight and Foraging </strong>Moths are the major  item of diet. In the Kimberley their stomachs also contained grasshoppers and  in the Top End they also ate leaf-hoppers, ants, occasional beetles, flies and  spiders. In forested areas this species flies high, from just above the canopy to  many times canopy height. In more open areas such as grasslands and over water,  they fly lower, within a couple of metres of the ground. Flight is very fast  and typically relatively level with swift shallow dives. Flight speeds of 20 to  32 km/hr have been recorded. When exiting from a cave their flight is sharply  zigzagged presumably to reduce predation. They are often predated upon by Ghost  Bats <em>Macroderma gigas </em>as they exit the cave. </p>
<p><strong>Vocalisations  and Echolocation calls&nbsp; </strong><br>
  Characteristic  frequency 48.5 kHz, similar in many respects to <em>Pipistrellus westralis</em>.  The pulse shape is curvilinear and has a relatively high initial section and  usually no or at most a very short tail. Although the frequency range for <em>M.  o. orianae</em> extends slightly higher than <em>Pipistrellus westralis</em>, it is  considered that it can not be confidently separated given the limited number of  reference calls collected for <em>P.westralis.</em> <br>
