<body style='background-color: transparent;'><p><strong>Flute-nosed  Bat</strong><br>
  <em>Murina  florium </em><br>
Thomas, 1908</p>
<p><strong>Other  Names </strong>Insectivorous  Tube-nosed Bat, </p>
<p><strong>Description</strong> This elusive and unusual bat has <strong>tubular  nostrils</strong> that diverge and <strong>extend sideways</strong> from the <strong>end of the nose</strong>. The <strong>fur on the back is grey-brown to an orange rufous-brown</strong> with the base of the fur dark to light grey. The fur is long and  woolly with a grizzled appearance and is paler on the belly. The <strong>fur extends over most of the tail membrane</strong> and along the bones of the wings and legs. The ears are short and  rounded with the rear margins deeply notched. The wing membrane is attached  along the outer edge of the first toe. The thumbs are unusually long. They <strong>emit a loud drawn-out, high-pitched whistle</strong> while foraging. </p>
<p><strong>Habitat</strong> Captures have been in both upland and lowland tropical rainforest  (microphyll fern-vine, notophyll vine &amp; mesophyll forest) often with  emergent eucalypts. They are also found in tall open forest of flooded gums (<em>Eucalyptus grandis</em>) with or  without rainforest understorey, in gallery forests, occasionally in dry  sclerophyll forest and disturbed forest. They are found from the lowlands to  elevations of 1,200 m (up to 2,800 m outside Australia). They are more common  at higher elevations.&nbsp; </p>
<p><strong>Roost  Habits</strong> These distinctive bats live in the wet  rainforests of north Queensland. They roost in the understorey 1 to 8 m from  the ground wherever they find suitable cover. They are known to roost in suspended  clusters of fallen leaves, the curled dead base of epiphytes, tree fern and  palm fronds, disused nests of Fernwrens (<em>Oreoscopus  gutturalis</em>) and Yellow-throated Scrubwrens (<em>Sericornis citreogularis</em>). The bird  nests often have a hole in the base that may have been made by the bat. All  roosts have been in simple microphyll vine forest. Over 80% of roosts are  occupied by a single bat but up to a dozen may share a simple roost such as a  curled dead leaf. One individual was found roosting in the nest of a Sacred  Kingfisher (<em>Todiramphus sanctus</em>) inside a termite mound in a tree. Several bats released during the  day landed on broad leaves and wrapped them around, holding the leaves in this  position with their feet and thumb claws so that they could not be seen except  from directly below. This bat is also unusual in the way it roosts hanging by  its toes and wrapping its wings around its body, like a flying fox but keeping  the wings out from the chest to form an &ldquo;umbrella&rdquo;.&nbsp; </p>
<p><strong>Diet,  Flight and Foraging </strong>They forage in the canopy and sub-canopy and  avoid open areas. Their wings are long and have low wing loading and low aspect  ratio suggesting agile and manoeuvrable flight at low speed. Individuals  emerging at dusk hover briefly under roosts and exit the roost area through  vine tendrils, branches and other cluttered situations. They have a very slow  and manoeuvrable flight. Scat analysis has shown their diet to consist of  two-thirds beetles, one-third spiders, with traces of moths and flies.  Coprophagy (eating its own faces) has been observed in this bat in captivity.  It is the only Australian bat known to do this. In captivity they have been  observed to roost to eat their prey. They Initially land with their feet and  then hook onto the branch with their long thumbs and release their feet.  Keeping the body curled around they hang by their thumbs bringing the tail up  close to the face to catch any food that escapes their mouth. This method was  observed and filmed several times by Jenny McLean at the Tolga Bat Hospital  with a captive Murina eating mealworms. </p>
<p><strong>Vocalisation  and Echolocation </strong>Flute-nosed Bats emit low-intensity wide  frequency range echolocation calls of short duration (1.5 to 2 ms). The  combination of manoeuvrable flight characteristics and broad frequency range  echolocation calls indicates this bat is specialised for foraging within a  cluttered environment. The high frequency calls are thought to allow  sophisticated texture resolution enabling the spectral discrimination of  stationary prey.&nbsp; They are very vocal  while foraging producing a drawn-out high pitched audible whistle.&nbsp; This social call occurs in 20 millisecond  bursts at 10 kHz. It is the only Australian bat to make this type of call  (giving it the name Flute-nosed Bat).&nbsp; </p>
<p><strong>Notes </strong>Flute-nosed Bats have extremely large olfactory areas of the brain and  the large tube-like nostrils indicate that their sense of smell is very well  developed, an unusual characteristic for echolocating bats. </p>
