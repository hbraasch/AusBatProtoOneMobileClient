  <em>Myotis  macropus</em> <br>
(Gould, 1855)</p>
<p><strong>Other  Names</strong><em> Myotis adversus</em> </p>
<p><strong>Description</strong> This fascinating fishing bat can be distinguished from all other  Australian vespertilionid bats by its <strong>disproportionately  large feet</strong>, (8 to 11 mm, not including claws), they are <strong>almost </strong><strong>half the length of the tibia, if not larger</strong>. Its fur colour is variable from grey to dark brown above, slightly  paler below; old bats may have ginger coloured fur. Albinisim (or partial  albinism) is not uncommon. The ears are long with a rounded tip and the tragus  is long, straight and slender. The calcar (a cartilage strut extending from the  ankle and supporting the rear edge of the tail membrane) is very long,  extending more than half way from the ankle to the tail tip.</p>
<p><strong>Habitat </strong>They are always near water and have a strong  association with streams and permanent waterways, most frequently at low  elevations and in flat or undulating country and usually in areas that are  vegetated rather than cleared. They will live in most habitat types ranging  from rainforest streams to inland rivers, large lakes and reservoirs. This also  includes brackish and salt water habitats such as creeks and inlets amongst  mangroves.</p>
<p><strong>Roost  Habits </strong>Large-footed Myotis roost near water in caves,  tree hollows, amongst vegetation, in clumps of <em>Pandanus</em>, under bridges, in mines,  tunnels, road culverts and storm water drains. They are commonly found roosting  alone or in pairs in abandoned intact fairy martin nests. They will select  caves that overhang pools even when these are rather exposed. Colonies of  several hundred are known but more commonly they roost in groups of less than  15. In the breeding season&nbsp; each male  establishes a territory, excludes other males and forms a harem of 1 to 12  females. When not breeding, males either roost alone or form bachelor groups of  up to 20 individuals. Older males can be recognised by the scars on their ears  resulting from aggressive encounters when defending their territory. </p>
<p><strong>Diet,  Flight and Foraging </strong>The Large-footed Myotis, <em>Myotis macropus</em>, is the only  bat in Australia specialised for foraging directly over water surfaces. Such  highly specialised feeding ecology restricts the distribution of M. macropus to  coastal regions and inland waterways. They commonly forage over water for small  fish, prawns and aquatic insects such as water boatmen, water striders,  backswimmers and whirligig beetles. These are mainly species that live on or  just below the water surface and are caught by trawling. </p>
<p>The bats may  forage individually but more commonly they hunt together. Sometimes several  bats follow each other while foraging along similar flight paths.</p>
<p>The bats fly 15  to 100 cm above the water frequently dipping their big feet into the water and  briefly raking them along the surface.&nbsp;  They have a preference for large still pools rather than flowing  streams. It is thought that they use echolocation to detect the small ripples  made by prey on the water surface. These bats are also aerial foragers, usually  hunting insects that fly over water. In the Top End their diet is more  terrestrial with scats containing mostly termites, flies, ants, moths, beetles,  spiders, cockroaches and bugs. They also forage over salt water in mangroves  and coastal areas with calm conditions. </p>
<p>Flight  observations made in the Kimberley show that when foraging over water,&nbsp; Large Footed Myotis have relatively fast  flight, low over the water surface (1 cm to 1 m high), with frequent changes in  direction, but not extreme turns. All turns were horizontal banks (banked up to  70o), they could  make these agile turns at full speed of 26 to 30 kph. When foraging on land  they use moderate to slow flight, low to the ground, less than 1 to 2 m  occasionally up to 4 m above the grass. They use straight or curving sinuous  flight with long circling, co-ordinated turns with no abrupt manoeuvres. They  often fly a repeated pattern over the water, foraging back and forth along the  edge of the vegetation and zigzagging out over open water. </p>
<p><strong>Vocalisations  and Echolocation calls </strong>Steep, near vertical calls,  starting at between 70 to 80 kHz usually dropping to between 35 to 40 kHz (n =  21). Good quality calls have a central kink around 47 to 50kHz and very  occasionally another prior to the tail dropping off around 35 kHz. Appears very  similar to calls of <em>Nyctophilus</em> and could be easily confused. </p>
<p><strong>Conservation </strong><em>M. macropus</em> is a  habitat specialist, reliant on intact, mature riparian vegetation and  relatively open, permanent water ways. Such ecological specialisation has led  to the species&rsquo; restricted distribution and apparently low population  densities. Significant population structuring in Victoria implies movement of  individuals along waterways and between catchments is infrequent and that  migratory behaviour during winter is unlikely. Given the inherent increased  extinction risk faced by isolated, small populations of specialist species,  management actions should be directed towards maintenance, enhancement, and  linkage of riparian vegetation, including the retention of older habitat trees  that are more likely to contain hollows. These actions should promote the  movement of this uncommon species throughout the landscape.</p>
