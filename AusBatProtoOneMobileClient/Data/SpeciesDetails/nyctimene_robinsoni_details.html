  <em>Nyctimene  robinsoni </em><br>
Thomas, 1904</p>
<p><strong>Other  Names</strong> Eastern Tube-nosed Bat, Queensland Tube-nosed  Fruit Bat</p>
<p><strong>Description </strong>A beautifully marked fruit bat distinguished from  other species by its long, <strong>protruding,  tube-like nostrils</strong> and <strong>bright  yellow or green spots splashed across its wings and ears</strong>. The <strong>fur is grey to reddish brown</strong> all over with a distinct <strong>narrow  dark black stripe down along the spine</strong>. 
  <br>
The tubular  divergent nostrils are capable of opening and closing and moving independently  of one another. They are thought&nbsp; that  the nostrils work in stereo to help locate fruit at night by their odour  plumes. The eyes are large with a amber coloured irises and they give a strong  eye shine at night. The upper incisor teeth are present but it <strong>does not have lower incisors </strong>(they are  lost as juveniles) and the modified lower canines, are almost touching. The  tail is quite long but is mostly free of the tail membrane, except where it  joins at the base. The flight membrane between the hind legs is reduced to just  a narrow strip, about 10 mm wide. The wings join the feet at the second toe.  
<br>
They make a <strong>distinctive whistling call</strong> while in flight. In north Queensland they can be heard in the forest  most nights, often several bats calling at once. In New South Wales they only  call in the warmer months from October to April and are usually solitary. </p>
<p><strong>Roost Habits </strong>Queensland Tube-nosed Bats roost during the day  in foliage in the rainforest sub-canopy layer where they find effective  camouflage amongst the dead leaves. Individuals generally roost alone  approximately 4 to 6 m above the ground to higher up and out of sight in the  canopy. They roost with their wings wrapped around them and look like a cluster  of dead leaves. The illusion is enhanced by the yellow spots that provide a sun  dappled appearance and bats&rsquo; habit of occasionally rocking from side to side as  if the wind has disturbed them. Even very young bats learn this rocking habit  even while hanging on to Mum. They are very inconspicuous, even on quite  exposed foliage. One evening after measuring two individuals I had netted, I  placed them side by side on a low, nearby branch, about 2 m above the ground.  Expecting them to fly away during the night I gave them no further thought. The  following afternoon when packing up camp I noticed they were still there  although I must have walked within half a metre of them repeatedly for most of  the previous night and all that day. Both animals watched me through slitted  eyes, whenever I approached, but made no other movement. Some individuals roost  at the same place each day for years, others roost in the last tree they were  feeding in before dawn. They usually roost alone but groups of up to five  animals have been found roosting together. </p>
<p><strong>Habitat </strong>They occur in tropical rainforest, preferring  mature primary forest rather than secondary regrowth forest; sub-tropical rainforest,  complex notophyll vine forest, Araucarian notophyll vine forests, gallery  forests and wet sclerophyll forests. In subtropical areas they favour  stream-side habitats within coastal rainforest and moist eucalypt forests with  a well developed rainforest understorey. In New Guinea they occur in lowland  rainforest and monsoon forest with open understorey and virtually no shrub and  ground cover.</p>
<p><strong>Diet,  Flight and Foraging </strong>They eat a variety  of fleshy fruit from both understorey rainforest trees and canopy trees,  favouring figs (<em>Ficus</em> spp.such  as <em>F. varigata, F. congesta, F. copiosa, F.  nodosa </em>and <em>F.  watkinsiana</em>), native cherries <em>Eugenia spp</em>, lillipillies <em>Syzigium spp</em> and False  Gardenia <em>Atractocarpus sessilis</em>, and   many cauliferous fruits, which they consume either on the  spot or carry away. They are also extremely partial to many introduced fruits  such as Guava <em>Psidium guajava</em> and Soursop <em>Annona muricata</em>. </p>
<p>In New South Wales they tend to forage in the canopy over 20m above  the ground on rainforest tree fruits, including Maiden&lsquo;s Blush <em>Sloanea australis</em>, Yellow  Carabeen <em>S. woolsii</em>, Morton Bay Chestnut <em>Castanospermum  australe</em>, Bangalow Palm <em>Archontophoenix  cunninghamiana</em>, and Mistletoes. They also feed on the blossoms  of Burdekin Plum <em>Pleigynium timorense</em>, Blue Quondong <em>Eleocarpus  grandis</em> and <em>Eucalyptus</em> species. </p>
<p>They mainly eat firm to hard fruit that they hold against  their chest with their thumb claws and take large neat bites with their  modified lower canines. They chew the food for a considerable time and then  push it hard against the ridges on the roof of the mouth with their tongue and  squeeze all the liquid from it before spitting out the dry spat. The tongue has  4 circumvallate papillae (two large and two small) and has a complex papillae  arrangement and structure of an obligate frugivore. A small scattering of dry  spat can sometimes be found beneath favoured fruit trees (such as guavas). </p>
<p>  They have large  broad wings for their size enabling them to carry heavy loads of fruit (up to  30 g or half their own body weight) and to hover, turn around in mid-air, and  manoeuvre in dense vegetation. Queensland Tube-nosed Bats have a pronounced  daily activity pattern with their body temperature being lowest just after  sunset and the highest just before dawn. Their average daily core temperature  ranges from 34 to 38oC to as low as  32.6oC. </p>
<p>They remain  active throughout the night until just before dawn except on strongly moonlit  nights where they remain at the roost until the moon sets to avoid predation.  During the tropical winter the bats travel only very short distances (100 to  420 m) between feeding sites and different roost locations, and distances  between consecutive roost sites averaged 40m, thereby using comparatively  little energy for traveling, and saving energy for other activities. The energy  expenditure for this bat living in areas of moderate temperature fluctuations  and high food abundance is relatively low and does not require the use of  torpor for energy conservation. However the bats may use torpor during adverse  weather or at the subtropical southern end of their distribution range. The  basal metabolic rate for Queensland Tube-nosed Bats was measured at 54.7mlO2h-1 which is in the range reported for other similar sized fruit bats</p>
<p><strong>&nbsp;</strong><strong>Notes </strong>Queensland tube-nosed fruit bats are important seed dispersers and  pollinators for Australian rainforest trees. They are the only small,  understory, seed-dispersing bat. They carry seeds in their gut but also carry  fruit away to a feeding roost that may be a considerable distance from the  fruiting tree. </p>
