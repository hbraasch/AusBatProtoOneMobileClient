  <em>Nyctophilus  arnhemensis</em><br>
(Johnson, 1959)</p>
<p><strong>Other  Names</strong>Northern  Long-eared Bat</p>
<p><strong>Description</strong> The Arnhem Long-eared Bat is a <strong>medium  sized species </strong>(forearm 33.2 to 40 mm) with <strong>moderately long ears </strong>(16 to 21.5 mm).  The <strong>fur is usually light russet brown</strong> with dark bases to the hairs. The fur shades to a <strong>slightly lighter colour on the belly</strong> but is not distinctly different. The<strong> muzzle ridge is moderately developed </strong>and has a  central depression. The glans penis is a square ended cylinder with a flat  circular urethral opening on the underside, near the tip<strong>.</strong> The <strong>Pallid  Long-eared Bat</strong>, <em>N.  daedalus</em> is <strong>significantly  larger, </strong>with larger forearm 38.3 to 45.8 mm), longer ears  (20.5 to 25.8 mm), less developed muzzle ridge,<strong> </strong>a similar fur colour, and the glans penis is  divided by a longitudinal groove into two cylinders with the upper cylinder  projecting to give a distinct beaked appearance, OCW 5.1 mm (4.7 to 5.5 mm). The <strong>Pygmy  Long-eared Bat</strong>, <em>N.  walkeri,</em> is much smaller in all measurements, it has much  shorter ears (10.7 to 14.1 mm) and smaller forearm (30.1 to 36.0 mm), narrower  muzzle OCW of 3.6 mm (3.4 to 3.7 mm) with the belly fur distinctly paler than  back. <strong>The lesser Long-eared Bat</strong>, <em>N. geoffroyi</em> has a well developed muzzle ridge and white belly fur.</p>
<p><strong>Roost  Habits</strong> These bats have been found roosting 2 to 3 m  above the ground under hanging flaps of the soft, flexible bark of large  paperbark trees (<em>Melaleuca leucodendron</em>). They will also shelter in houses, within rainforest foliage and  amongst <em>Pandanus</em> leaves. </p>
<p><strong>Habitat</strong> They have been caught in large numbers in and around mangroves as  well as monsoon forest, open savannah woodland, tall open forest, and <em>Melaleuca</em>,<em> Pandanus </em>lined waterways and over  waterholes in sandstone country. In the Kimberley they were found foraging in  rainforest patches, in groves of cajuput and <em>Melaleuca  argentia </em>forest that fringe watercourses, and in woodlands  of <em>Tristania grandiflora </em>and <em>Melaleuca acacioides </em>around freshwater swamps. Their distribution tends to correspond to  the areas that receive an annual rainfall of over 500 mm. </p>
<p><strong>Diet,  Flight and Foraging </strong>They hunt amongst and alongside the foliage of  dense vegetation. Prey is gleaned from surfaces or caught in flight at  relatively slow speeds of 5 km/hr but they can fly at up to 24km/hr when  commuting. While foraging, the slow fluttering flight afforded by their short,  broad wings is well adapted to confined spaces where manoeuvrability is  preferable to speed. They are often seen flying through the vegetation or very  low along tracks and waterways, less than 50cm above the surface. Their flight  is very slow and irregular with frequent changes of direction and height,  making gentle coordinated turns often in tight curves. They are capable of  hovering and in the Top End their diet has been found to be composed of  predominantly termites, water-beetles, cockroaches, field crickets, bugs and  occasional moths and spiders. They have been also been recorded feeding on  geckos and gecko eggs but the details of this observation are unknown. Its search-mode echolocation pulses are broadly tuned  with most energy between 49&ndash;53 kHz and, to increase their effective range, call  sequences include occasional sub-sequences that step down to 38 kHz. Northern  Long-eared Bats commute at steady, level flight speeds of about 24 kph.<br>
    <strong>Reproduction </strong>&nbsp;Males have  scrotal testes from May to November. Females are pregnant in September and  November, twins are born from late October to February. Young are born, usually twins, from late in the dry season (October)  to the end of the wet season (February). </p>
<p><strong>Vocalisations  and Vocalisations and Echolocation calls NT </strong>Characteristic  frequency 49 to 53kHz. Calls are similar to <em>Myotis macropus</em>, as well as  other <em>Nyctophilus</em> species and are linear with the length of each call  varying considerably within a sequence.</p>
