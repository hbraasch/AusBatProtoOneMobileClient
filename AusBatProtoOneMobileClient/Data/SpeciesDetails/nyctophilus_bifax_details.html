<p><strong>Eastern Long-eared Bat </strong><br />
    <em>Nyctophilus bifax </em><br />
  (Thomas, 1915)</p>
<p><em>&nbsp;</em><strong>Description</strong> A large species of <em>Nyctophilus</em>, with a forearm of 37.5 to 46.8 mm.  The fur colour  is usually a rich brown-tan, often with the belly fur a lighter colour. The ears are long (19.2 to 27.1 mm). The muzzle ridge is poorly developed with a slight central depression  (Type 3). The glans penis  is a square ended cylinder with a flat circular urethral opening on the  underside, near the tip. The baculum is forked at the tip. Gould's Long-eared Bat, <em>N. gouldi</em>, differ by usually having longer  ears (greater than 24 mm), a better developed muzzle ridge (Type 2) and males  have a distinctly beaked glans penis. Corben&rsquo;s Long-eared Bat, <em>Nyctophilus corbeni</em> is found further inland, to the west  of the Great Dividing Range. It is larger with a broader muzzle and an OCW  greater than 5.7 whereas <em>N. bifax</em> is less than 5.3 mm. The Lesser Long-eared Bat N. <em>geoffroyi</em> is smaller with a better developed  muzzle ridge (Type 1).</p>
<p><strong>Roost Habits</strong> Eastern Long-eared Bats are forest  dwellers and have been recorded roosting under peeling bark, among epiphytes,  in tree hollows and shallow depressions on trunks and branches, in the roots of  strangler figs, amongst the dead fronds of a prickly tree fern and in foliage.  Tree hollows are used more than foliage when the females are lactating but  foliage roosts are more commonly used during the mating season. In northern New  South Wales, eastern Long-eared Bats shift foliage roosts seasonally to the  cooler forest interior in November (late spring) and back to the warmer forest  edge in May (late autumn). Roost mobility over seasons may be necessary for  foliage&ndash;roosting bats as such roosts are not thermally buffered. They have also  been reported to roost in buildings. Colonies of 2 to 7 have been recorded  (those examined contained only females). These aggregations were loose, and  females moved between colonies. Males tended to roost alone. Bats changed roost  frequently but showed a strong fidelity to one cluster of trees. Most roosts  were less than 250 m apart. At the southern end of their range, Eastern Long-eared Bats, <em>Nyctophilus bifax</em>, have been found to lower their body  temperature and enter torpor every day throughout winter. Both males and  females exhibited multi-day torpor bouts of up to 5.4 days. Torpor bouts were  longer during periods of lower temperatures. During summer when insects were  abundant male bats used torpor on 85% of days and 38% of nights. Torpor bouts  last for 1 to 21 hours. Individuals with large fat reserves had longer and  deeper torpor bouts and entered torpor more often than those with low body fat  reserves. Although torpor is effective for energy conservation it also entails  costs, such as reduced foetal development in pregnant females. Even in the  subtropics torpor is used regularly by non reproductive males to conserve  energy but is rarely used by pregnant females as it slowed foetal development. </p>
<p><strong>Habitat</strong> They favour wetter habitats ranging from  rainforest and monsoon forest to riverine forests of paperbark but are also  found in on open woodland, tall open forest and dry sclerophyll woodland. In  northern NSW they are restricted to rainforest. </p>
<p><strong>Diet, Flight and Foraging.</strong> At Chillagoe, Queensland they have  been observed perch hunting. The bats typically hang from perches 5 to 10 m  above the ground and pivot their body back and forth while echolocating. They  periodically make short, less than 3 m, flights from the perch presumably to catch  prey. After 3 to 5 minutes with no foraging flights the bats moved to another  perch, usually within 50 m. Dietary analysis has recorded moths, with traces of  ants and click-beetles in the stomach and scats. They tend to forage along the  edge of the tree canopy rather than within the foliage. As well as perch  hunting they catch prey by aerial capture and gleaning off surfaces. In  rainforest they were found to forage in the canopy over 25 m above the ground.</p>

<p><strong>Vocalisations and Vocalisations and  Echolocation calls. </strong>Steep, near vertical, starting at between 70 to 108 kHz usually  dropping to between 47 to 55 kHz (n = 10). Good quality calls usually have two  changes in the slope in the middle or lower half. The first section is longest  and steepest followed by a flatter section and then a steeper tail. All  Nyctophilus spp. are soft callers so short fragmentary calls are typical. Call  characteristics and frequencies almost completely overlap with <em>Nyctophilus gouldi</em>,  <em>N. geoffroyii</em>, and <em>N. corbeni</em> making them indistinguishable using standard  Anabat / Analook parameters. </p>
