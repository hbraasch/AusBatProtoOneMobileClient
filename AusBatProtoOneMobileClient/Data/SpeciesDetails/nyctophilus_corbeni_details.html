  <em>Nyctophilus  corbeni </em><br>
Parnaby, 2009</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Other  Names</strong><em> Nyctophilus timoriensis</em>, <em>Nyctophilus major </em>(part), Greater Long-eared bat, South-eastern Long-eared Bat.</p>
<p><strong>Description</strong> A rare species that occurs patchily across suitable habitat, this  species has only recently been formally described. The <strong>fur is dark sandy brown to grey brown</strong>, and <strong>only slightly lighter brown on the tips. </strong>The fur on the belly may be pale. The <strong>muzzle ridge is low</strong> and <strong>lacks a vertical groove. </strong>Comparing the  sizes of the larger Long-eared Bat species can be confusing, and so we suggest  that attention should be first directed to the <strong>outer  canine</strong> <strong>width</strong> (OCW) for these species. <em>N. corbeni</em> has an OCW that <strong>is greater than 5.6 mm</strong>; <em>N. gouldi</em> and <em>N. bifax</em> have OCW&rsquo;s in the range of 4.8 to 5.4mm but have distinctly  different muzzle ridges (which need to be examined with a hand lens). Please  refer to the muzzle images herein. &nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Roost  Habits</strong> In South Australia they roost in hollows of live  trees including <em>Casuarina pauper</em>, <em>Myoporum platycarpum</em> and the mallee <em>Eucalyptus  gracilis</em>. In Queensland they roost in bulloak,  brigalow/belah communities and ironbark woodlands. Roost hollows are reported  to be less than 3m above the ground; with multiple small entrances of 5 to 10cm.  Elsewhere they roost in fissures in branches and under dried sheets of bark  still attached to the trunks of ring-barked trees. They forage up to 3 km from  the roost. Tree hollows are also used as maternity sites. </p>
<p><strong>Habitat</strong> Corben&rsquo;s Long-eared Batsare most abundant where the vegetation has a distinct canopy and a  dense, cluttered understorey layer. They inhabit a wide variety of vegetation  types including River Red Gum, <em>Eucalyptus  camaldulensis</em>, Black Box, <em>Allocasuarina</em>, Belah, Mallee, open woodlands and savannahs. They are most common in  box, ironbark and cypress open forests and bulloke woodlands of inland northern  New South Wales. In South Australia they are confined to tall mallee  shrublands. In Queensland they have been recorded from semi-evergreen vine  thicket with <em>Brachychiton </em>emergents, inland dry sclerophyll forest with <em>Corymbia citriodora</em> and ironbark,  open forest with grass trees, <em>Callitris</em> forest, mixed eucalypt forest, poplar box open forest, open forest  with mid-storey of <em>Allocasuarina</em> and <em>Callitris</em>. It is very common in the Pilliga Scrub in New South Wales where it  comprised up to 9 percent of all bat captures. </p>
<p><strong>Diet,  Flight and Foraging </strong>They are highly manoeuvrable bats that are able  to change direction often and quickly. They fly very close to vegetation, often  weaving through the canopy but also flying through gaps. They have been seen to  catch insects by first flying high and then swooping almost to the ground. They  usually fly at canopy height (4 to 5 m) but this depends on the vegetation type  through which they are foraging. They hunt by aerial foraging and by gleaning  their prey from the surface of vegetation or the ground. Their diet has not  been examined.</p>
<p><strong>Vocalisations  and Vocalisations and Echolocation calls Calls are </strong>almost identical in shape and characteristics to other <em>Nyctophilus</em> species and are near vertical, starting at between 60 and 80 kHz, usually  dropping to between 31 to 37 kHz (n = 16). </p>
