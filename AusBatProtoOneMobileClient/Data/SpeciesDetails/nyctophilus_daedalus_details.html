  <em>Nyctophilus  daedalus</em><br>
Thomas, 1915 </p>
<p><strong>Other  Names</strong><em> Nyctophilus bifax </em>(part)<em>,</em> <em>Nyctophilus bifax daedalus</em>, <em>Nyctophilus gouldi bifax</em>, Northern  Long-eared Bat (part), </p>
<p><strong>Description</strong> A large species of <em>Nyctophilus</em> with a <strong>forearm of 38.5 to 45.6 mm</strong>. The <strong>fur colour is a pale sandy brown</strong>, with the belly fur a lighter brown. The <strong>ears are long</strong> (20.5 to 25.8 mm). The <strong>muzzle ridge is poorly developed</strong> with a slight central depression. <strong>The  glans penis is divided by a longitudinal groove into two cylinders with the  upper cylinder projecting to give a distinct beaked appearance</strong>. It is most likely to be confused with the Arnhem Leaf-nosed Bat <em>N. arnhemensis</em> which is a  smaller build (forearm 33 to 40 mm, weight 5 to 10 gm), with shorter ears (16 to  21 mm), and a better developed muzzle ridge. The glans penis in <em>N. arnhemensis</em> is a blunt square-ended cylinder and not distinctly beaked. The eastern  Long-eared Bat, <em>N. bifax,</em> is superficially similar but is much darker and differs in the shape  of the glans penis which is blunt and not beaked, the baculum is short,  tapering, and unforked and the upper third molar is reduced and shortened. The  pygmy Long-eared Bat <em>N. walkeri</em> and the lesser Long-eared Bat N. <em>geoffroyi</em> are both smaller with better developed muzzle ridges.</p>
<p><strong>Roost  Habits</strong> They are forest dwellers and have been recorded  roosting under the soft and peeling bark of <em>Melaleuca</em> trees, in tree hollows, at the base of <em>Pandanus</em> leaves and in foliage.</p>
<p><strong>Habitat</strong> They favour wetter habitats ranging from monsoon forest to riverine  vegetation of <em>Melaleuca, Lophostemon</em> and <em>Pandanus</em>, but are  also found in open woodland and tall open forest. </p>
<p><strong>Diet,  Flight and Foraging </strong>Pallid Long-eared Batsare perch hunters that catch prey by aerial  capture or gleaning off surfaces, such as foliage within and below the canopy  and along the edges of denser forest types and waterways. Their flight is  faster and more direct than that of other <em>Nyctophilus </em>with speeds of 20km/hr recorded. The Pallid Long-eared Bat, <em>N. daedalus,</em> incurs high  energy costs in hovering and manoeuvring at low speeds while gleaning in  clutter because of its relatively high wing loading (5.6 verses 4.8 N m-2 when compared with the less habitat-restricted Lesser Long-eared Bat, <em>Nyctophilus geoffroyi</em>). This may  explain their choice of denser habitat as these riparian areas provide a  greater abundance of insects than lightly wooded habitats. In the Top End they  eat predominantly beetles (78%) and cicadas (22%). </p>
<p><strong>Echolocation</strong> The mean peak power frequency is 52.4 kHz; range 50 to 54 kHz. It has  a slightly higher and wider range of peak frequencies than other tropical <em>Nyctophilus</em><strong><em>.</em></strong> The linear pulse shape of the <em>Nyctophilus</em> echolocation call allows  these species to detect details of texture in their immediate environment such  as a camouflaged moth perched on a leaf. It is less appropriate for detecting  the speed and direction of flying insects but is ideally suited for the gleaning  mode of foraging used by Long-eared Bats.</p>
