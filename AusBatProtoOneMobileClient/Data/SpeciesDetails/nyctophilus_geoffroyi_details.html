<body style='background-color: transparent;'><p><strong>Lesser  Long-eared Bat</strong><br>
  <em>Nyctophilus  geoffroyi</em><br>
Leach, 1821</p>
<p><strong>Description</strong> This beautiful bat is a <strong>medium  sized species</strong> (forearm 30.6 to 41.7 mm) with <strong>very long ears </strong>(17.6 to 25.3  mm). The <strong>fur is light grey on the back</strong> and <strong>distinctly lighter, often white, on the  belly</strong>. The <strong>hairs  are bicoloured</strong> being very dark at the base. It has a <strong>high muzzle ridge </strong>that is incised  with deep groove that diverges to the rear and is bridged by an elastic  membrane of skin, giving the ridge a <strong>distinctive  &quot;Y-shaped&quot; groove, </strong>that  distinguishes it from all other species. The OCW is 4.3 mm (4.0 to 4.9 mm). N.  geoffroyi is likely to represent a species complex and requires further  taxonomic research.</p>
<p><strong>Roost  Habits</strong> These bats are present in large numbers in many  areas of Australia. They commonly roost in tree crevices, under lifting and  peeling bark, in tree hollows and in buildings. We have found them roosting  inside rolled up canvas swags, in old coats and other hanging clothing; also in  fairy martin nests, they have also be recorded roosting under piles of bricks.  They roost alone or small groups of 2 to 3, but in some areas maternity  colonies of 10 to 15 females are formed, often with a single adult male. A  large colony of several hundred bats has been found in a building. <br>
  Dead specimens  have been recorded from caves in the Nullarbor, including one group of fifty. A  live cave colony is known from the Margaret River caves area in Western  Australia. They shift roost sites regularly within a defined area. In Victoria,  maternity roosts were found to be 6 to 12 km from foraging areas, in patches of  extensive woodland. </p>
<p><strong>Habitat</strong> They are found throughout Australia and Tasmania from deserts to  rainforests, wet to dry sclerophyll forests, tropical to alpine woodlands,  grasslands, mangroves, agricultural land and urban areas.</p>
<p><strong>Diet,  Flight and Foraging </strong>Their flight is slow, wobbly, irregular and  highly manoeuvrable with frequent changes in direction. They fly close to the  vegetation and into the understorey. In forests they forage about 6-10 m above  the ground, catching flying insects with sudden gliding changes in direction or  by dropping vertically, sometimes to within a few centimetres of the ground. In  open areas they fly lower, spiralling around shrubs and bushes with gentle  turns. They can land on the ground to capture prey, taking flight again almost  vertically. They have been observed to hover and can take off from water.  Flight speeds when foraging are as low as 4 km/hr. Commuting flight was up to  20 km/hr. <br>
  Moths, crickets  and grasshoppers are the commonest food type but they also eat wingless insects  such as ants, cricket nymphs and spiders, as well as beetles, cockroaches,  bugs, flies and lacewings. They have been captured in pit-traps, probably  attracted by the sounds of captured insects. They use a variety of prey capture  methods including echolocation (for gleaning ground and foliage prey, and  aerial prey), passive listening (for ground and aerial prey) and visual cues  (for aerial prey). These bats may exploit seasonally high concentrations of  calling Tettigoniid crickets, hunting by passive listening for the cricket  calls without echolocating or seeing them. In the Northern Territory they were  found to eat mostly crickets (62%) and cockroaches (35%). In the southern  highlands in summer they concentrated on Bogong moths, with only occasional  cricket nymphs and ants. </p>
