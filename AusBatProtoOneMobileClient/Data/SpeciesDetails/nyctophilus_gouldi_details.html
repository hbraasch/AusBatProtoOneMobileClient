  <em>Nyctophilus  gouldi </em><br>
Tomes, 1858</p>
<p><strong>Other  Names</strong><em> Nyctophilus timoriensis gouldi,</em> Greater Long-eared Bat</p>
<p><strong>Description </strong>This well-studied species has <strong>slate grey to grey-brown fur on the back </strong>with an <strong>ash-grey belly</strong>. The size varies from north to south being much larger in the south.  The ears are long (24.3 to 30.1 mm). The muzzle ridge is moderately developed  with a <strong>faint vertical groove</strong>. The glans penis is divided by a longitudinal groove into two  cylinders, with the upper one projecting to give a distinctly beak-like  appearance at the tip. The eastern Long-eared Bat, <em>N. bifax</em>, differs in having a less  developed muzzle ridge, usually shorter ears (19.2 to 27.1 mm) and the glans  penis is a square ended cylinder that is not beaked. <em>N gouldi</em> has an outer canine width  (OCW) of less than 5.1 mm, which separates this species from Corben&rsquo;s  Long-eared Bat <em>Nyctophilus corbeni </em>with OCW&rsquo;s of over 5.6 mm. </p>
<p><strong>Roost  Habits</strong> These bats roost in tree hollows, in fissures  and under exfoliating bark, even in hollows in fallen logs. Often, a particular  group of trees, often along a creek line, is used for roosting. Within this  group they select new roosts frequently, usually moving about 160m daily,  sometimes returning after 2 to 4 days. Females form colonies of 20 or more,  while males roost alone or in small transient groups of less than 6. Lactating  females form maternity colonies in tree hollows often in dead trees. They move  their young to new roosts a distance of 100 to 200m, every night.</p>
<p>In southern  Australia they lay down body fat in late summer and hibernate from April until  September. </p>
<p><strong>Habitat </strong>They are found in a variety of habitats from very  wet to semi-arid environments. They occur in rainforest, wet and dry  sclerophyll forest, <em>Melaleuca</em> woodland, river red gum lined waterways, woodlands and <em>Acacia</em> shrubland. </p>
<p><strong>Diet,  Flight and Foraging </strong>These bats typically fly slowly in large circles  approximately 2 to 5 m above the ground, and occasionally within the canopy of  forest trees. They have been observed to land on the ground to catch prey.  Their diet consists of mainly moths and beetles, but crickets, flies,  cockroaches, ants, bugs and spiders are also taken. Insects are caught on the  wing or gleaned from surfaces of vegetation or the ground using a variety of  techniques, such as passive listening, vision and echolocation. Although their  echolocation is highly sophisticated it is not used for orientation except in  unfamiliar environments, nor is it used when they approach fluttering prey, as  they rely instead on passive listening. This behaviour circumvents the evasive  action of sonar-sensitive insects. They can also perch-hunt using passive  listening. Visual cues are used to capture flying insects but not substrate  prey.</p>
<p><strong>Vocalisations  and Echolocation calls </strong>are  almost identical in shape and characteristics to other <em>Nyctophilus</em> species. They are near vertical, starting at between 65 and 80 kHz, usually  dropping to between 35 to 43 kHz (n = 56). </p>
