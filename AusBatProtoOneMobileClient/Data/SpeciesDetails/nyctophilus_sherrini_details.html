<body style='background-color: transparent;'><p><strong>Tasmanian  Long-eared Bat</strong><br>
  <em>Nyctophilus  sherrini </em><br>
Thomas 1915 </p>
<p><em>&nbsp;</em><strong>Other  Names</strong><em> Nyctophilus timoriensis </em>(part)<em>, </em>Greater  Long-eared Bat</p>
<p><strong>Description</strong> The fur is <strong>dark brown on the back</strong> and lighter brown on the <strong>belly</strong>. It is a large bat with a forearm length of 43.9 to 48.0mm. The <strong>muzzle ridge</strong> is <strong>poorly developed</strong> being low with  only a <strong>shallow central depression</strong>. The Lesser Long-eared Bat, <em>N.  geoffroyi</em> is the only other long-eared bat in Tasmania. It  differs by having a well developed <strong>muzzle  ridge with a Y-shaped groove</strong>, light  grey-brown fur on the back with a paler belly and <strong>smaller size, forearm less than 42 mm</strong>. <br>
  The Tasmanian Long-eared Bat, <em>Nyctophilus sherrini, </em>is most closely  related to the Greater Long-eared Bat <em>N.  major</em>, but it has a smaller and differently shaped  skull and shorter tooth row. Externally it resembles larger examples of Gould&rsquo;s  Long-eared Bat, <em>N. gouldi</em> from high rainfall areas of mainland Australia, but is distinguished  from <em>N. gouldi</em> by the more inflated brain case and proportionately narrower skull.</p>
<p><strong>Roost  Habits</strong> Tasmanian Long-eared Bats usually roost alone in  hollow limbs, fissures in branches, and under dried sheets of bark still  attached to the trunks of dead trees. They also form large breeding colonies in  tree hollows. They show a preference for trunk or branch roosts in mature  forests </p>
<p><strong>Habitat</strong> They are most common in moister habitats such as wet sclerophyll and  rainforest. They also occur in Blackwood swamps, <em>Acacia melanoxylon</em> forest with 20m  canopy and rainforest-like understorey, dense Tea Tree to 7m, coastal Mallee,  as well as gullies and creeks in dry sclerophyll forests. They are more  commonly associated with tracks than with water.</p>
<p><strong>Diet,  Flight and Foraging </strong>&nbsp;They  appear to specialize in non-flying insects eating mainly caterpillars (85%)  scorpions (5%) and moths. These are captured by gleaning in the understorey.  They spend part of their time foraging on the ground and they have been  captured in pitfall traps. They have the broadest wings of all the Tasmanian  bats and have the slowest flight. Their flight is undulating and agile as the  bat slips in and out of the understorey. They are highly maneuverable, flying  close to vegetation often in the lowest densest layer of the forest.</p>
