  <em>Nyctophilus  walkeri </em><br>
Thomas, 1892</p>
<p><em>&nbsp;</em></p>
<p><strong>Description</strong> A small and distinctive bat, it is the <strong>smallest species of Long-eared Bat</strong>. The <strong>fur is pale orange-brown on the back</strong> with a <strong>contrasting cream belly</strong> and <strong>dark wing membranes</strong>. It is identified by its <strong>small  size, forearm 33.1 mm&nbsp; (30.1 to 36.0 mm)  and short ears 12.9 mm (10.7 to 15.1 mm)</strong> when compared  to other Long-eared Bats. There is a <strong>small  but distinct muzzle ridge with a distinct central groove</strong>. </p>
<p><strong>Roost  Habits</strong> I (S.C.) have found them roosting in the dead  fronds of large <em>Livistonia </em>palms, 10m above the ground. They were roosting in such large numbers  that they could be heard squabbling with each other throughout the day. I have  also seen them emerge at dusk from thickets of <em>Pandanus</em> at the water's edge.</p>
<p><strong>Habitat</strong> Pygmy Long-eared Bats are usually found in association with  watercourses and permanent water. They have been caught in riverine forest of <em>Melaleuca</em> and <em>Pandanus</em>, monsoon rainforest  patches, open savannah woodland, tall open forest and mixed shrubland. The  dominant feature of most of these localities was the presence of <em>Melaleuca</em> and <em>Pandanus</em>. They  have a preference for escarpment areas. </p>
<p><strong>Diet,  Flight and Foraging </strong>They forage by aerial capture or gleaning off the  ground and other surfaces, such as foliage in vegetation thickets low to the  ground in denser forest types (e.g. monsoon thickets and riverine forest),  above pools, and in adjacent open woodland associated with watercourses At one  site in Queensland I (S.C.) have seen them in hundreds flying over the water  surface at night and staying out foraging until well after dawn. They fly low,  often within 1 to 2 meters of the ground or water surface and they are capable  of flying in complex vegetation such as between the prickly leaves of <em>Pandanus</em>. The flight is jerky and  irregular, 2 to 3 wing flaps followed by a glide, then a couple more flaps.  This unpredictable alternation in flight may help them to avoid predators. In the  Top End they eat mainly moths and beetles, but also cockroaches, termites,  mosquitoes, leaf-hoppers, lacewings and spiders.</p>
<p><strong>Reproduction</strong> There is little information. In the Northern Territory one female was  caught in late September in early pregnancy with twins (crown-rump length 3.8 mm)  and three females in mid-October were in advanced pregnancy. In the Kimberley  also, a female was pregnant with a fetus in each uterine horn in October. Young  are probably born in early November.</p>
<p><strong>Vocalisations  and Echolocation calls </strong>have a<strong> </strong>characteristic frequency of about 54.7 kHz and are similar to calls of  other Nyctophilus. &nbsp;</p>
