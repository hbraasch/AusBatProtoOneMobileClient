  <em>Ozimops  halli</em> <br>
(Reardon, McKenzie and Adams, 2014)</p>
<p><strong>Other  Names</strong><em> Mormopterus (Ozimops) halli, Mormopterus </em>species 5 (populations S &amp; T),<em> Mormopterus loriae ridei, Mormopterus planiceps ridei and Mormopterus ridei </em>(part)<em>.</em></p>
<p><strong>Distribution</strong>. The Cape York Free-tailed Bat, <em>Ozimops  halli</em> was known from only 11 specimens when it was  described in 2014 and collected from only two disparate locations: near Coen in  central Cape York Peninsula and near Normanton in the Gulf Country. More  recently (October 2018) we (S.C.,B.T.) captured two females approximately half  way between these sites. </p>
<p><strong>Description </strong>A small stout species with forearm length of 34.1  mm (31.1 to 35.3 mm) and weight of 9.4 g. (9.0 to 10.3 g). Dorsal fur variable  from rich brown to orange brown with grey flecks and only weakly contrasting  with lighter ventral fur; yellowish tinge to the fur on the side of the neck.  Skin on ears, wings, and muzzle and under the chin very dark brown; ears with  half round antitragus. Distinguishable from all other Ozimops by having a short  tapering glans penis with a ventral transverse lip at about half the length of  the glans body, and with large epithelial spines that cover the glans body  dorsally from the head to the base and ventrally from the lip to the base. Two  females captured in early October 2018 had a lot of fat around their rump and a  very distinctive and abrupt hair line above the tail</p>
<p><strong>Roost  Habits</strong><br>
  Natural roosts  are unknown although likely to be tree hollows. </p>
<p><strong>Habitat</strong><br>
  All specimens  have been captured by mist nets and over, or very near to, fresh water in  woodland habitats. Vegetation ranged from moderately dense eucalypt woodland to  very open eucalypt on black soils.</p>
<p><strong>Diet,  Flight and Foraging </strong><br>
  High fast flying  above vegetation. We (S.C.,B.T) saw these bats flying high and fast around a  pair of small dams not long after sunset. They did not come down to drink,  instead they flew well above our mist nets repeatedly flying back and forth 5  to 6m above the dams, then veering off to fly above the trees and then back  over the dams. Several hours later when the night had cooled and the insects  were flying lower, the bats returned and we captured them in the nets 2 meters  above the water. Scats collected from these individuals contained mainly bugs  (Hemiptera) and a small beetle.&nbsp; At the  time there were very few insects available. </p>
<p><strong>Vocalisations  and Echolocation calls </strong>are short (7 - 14ms)  FM with a characteristic frequency of 28-33KHz, typically extending from about  40kHz (53kHz, n=1) and ending at about 28 to 29kHz. As with other <em>Ozimops</em>,  there are two call types with the second type being relatively flat range: 32 &ndash; 29kHz  but with similar characteristic freq. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
