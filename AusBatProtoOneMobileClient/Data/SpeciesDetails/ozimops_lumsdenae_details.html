  <em>Ozimops  lumsdenae</em><br>
(Reardon, McKenzie &amp; Adams, 2014)</p>
<p><strong>Other  Names</strong> <em>Mormopterus  (Ozimops) lumsdenae,</em> <em>Mormopterus  beccarii</em>, <em>Tadarida  beccarii. </em>Beccari&rsquo;s Free-tailed Bat, Lumsden&rsquo;s Free-tailed  bat.</p>
<p><strong>Description</strong> A thick, muscular and <strong>robust  body shape</strong>. This is the <strong>largest  species of </strong><strong><em>Ozimops, </em></strong>(forearm 35.2&ndash;40.4 mm, mass 11&ndash;19.5 g), with all external measures  (except D5MP, the middle phalanx on the 5th finger, that determine wing shape)  averaging much greater than for other species. The <strong>fur is</strong> <strong>short  and bicoloured. </strong>On the <strong>back,  it ranges from rich brown to sandy grey</strong>.<strong> with paler bases darker tips. </strong>The fur  is <strong>distinctly paler on the belly</strong>. The skin on the face, ears and wings is brown to dark grey. The ears  are triangular, rounded at tip and not joined together. The skull is sinuate  and the <strong>first upper premolar is minute</strong>. Females have a long clitoral projection. </p>
<p><strong>Roost  Habits</strong> Northern Free-tailed Bats roost commonly in tree  hollows but have also been found in caves in New Guinea. They often roost in  the roofs of houses in Queensland and colonies of up to 50 have been recorded.  Several of these bats were found roosting in an old horse blanket in a shed and  another one was under the topping cap of a telegraph pole. A survey near  Kununurra found this species to be widespread in low numbers in all natural  habitats but it was not detected in agricultural areas.</p>
<p><strong>Habitat </strong>These bats occupy a broad range of habitats from  rainforest, river flood plains, tall open forest, savannah woodlands, arid  shrub lands and grasslands. They are commonly caught along water courses, lined  with river red gums, in arid areas. Across this distribution it is found in  drier shrublands and grasslands to rainforest. It occurs in arid and semiarid  areas of Western Australia north of 26S, where it favours woodland patches and  riparian zones (McKenzie and Bullen 2009). </p>
<p><strong>Diet,  Flight and Foraging </strong>They have short narrow and pointed wings and fly  with very rapid wing beats. In flight they have an interceptor foraging  strategy. Flight is fast and straight with gentle curves but no tight or abrupt  turns. Horizontal turns are frequent when foraging along a canopy edge. They  are manoeuvrable at relatively high speed only, so they prefer to forage in  areas relatively free of obstructions, either above the canopy, or beside  treetops, cliffs, slopes or hilltops, and along water courses, favouring sites  with well developed riparian zones and permanent pools. As they fly over water  they come lower and are often caught in mist nets. When commuting to and from  feeding grounds they flatten their wings and retract their hairy feet into  pouches in the tail membrane&rsquo;s trailing edge. Although this sacrifices  manoeuvrability it further reduces drag, allowing the bats to fly faster and  more efficiently. They have been recorded flying at speeds of 28km/hr. Their  diet is predominantly aerial moths and beetles, but they also eat bugs,  lacewings, flies and grasshoppers. In the Top End stomachs contained  predominantly flightless ants (54%). The presence of flightless insects  suggests that it captures prey by scurrying on the ground. They are certainly  very agile on the ground and can run surprisingly fast.</p>
<p><strong>Echolocation calls </strong>are short FM or almost flat with a duration of 5 - 17ms and characteristic  frequency of 23 &ndash; 25kHz, range 23 &ndash; 28kHz. </p>
