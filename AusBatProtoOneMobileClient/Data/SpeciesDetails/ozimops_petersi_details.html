<p><strong>Inland  Free-tailed Bat</strong><br />
    <em>Ozimops  petersi</em> <br />
  (Leche, 1884) </p>
<p><strong>Description</strong> The <strong>fur on the back is bicoloured, usually light  grey to light grey-brown with a creamy white base</strong>. The fur on the belly is notably paler, with creamy bases and very  light-brown tips. The <strong>skin on the ears, muzzle and wings is pink  to grey</strong>. <strong>Males  have a short penis (less than 3 mm).</strong> It is similar  to other Ozimops species.The ears are triangular and not joined across the top  of the head. The upper lip overhangs the lower lip and bears a fringe of stiff  hairs. There is a clinal increase in size of most wing (and cranial) measures  from south to north.</p>
<p><strong>Roost  Habits</strong> Inland Free-tailed Bats have a flat head and  body that enables them to squeeze into small roost sites such as cracks and  fissures in trees and posts, between roof beams and corrugated iron roofs, and  in lengths of water pipe. They most often roost in tree hollows preferring roosts  with small entrances. Colonies are usually small, less than 10. They often  roost in association with the inland Broad-nosed Bat, <em>Scotorepens balstoni. </em>Colonies usually  have several roosts in an area and move between them every few days. </p>
<p><strong>Habitat</strong> This species is common in the more arid parts of Australia, generally  associated with open woodland or shrubland and often caught along water courses  lined with river red gums. They have been found in cypress pine woodlands,  mallee, myall and mulga woodlands, chenopod shrublands and grasslands. They  tend to be more common in areas of taller vegetation associated with creek  lines and drainage areas.</p>
<p><strong>Diet,  Flight and Foraging </strong>&nbsp;Stomach  contents have included flies, winged and wingless ants. They tend to forage in  open unobstructed areas. When foraging over water they were observed to fly 3  to 5m above the surface and then drop rapidly for a few metres to scoop up  water before rising again to their previous height. They fly fast in open space  both above and below the canopy, over water or along tree-lined creeks where  they catch and eat insects while flying. They are fast but not very manoeuvrable  in flight. They will sometimes land and crawl rapidly over the ground and on  tree trunks chasing and eating prey.</p>
<p><strong>Vocalisations  and Echolocation calls</strong></p>
<p>Characteristic  frequency 29 to 36 kHz (n = 9). Call similar shape to other Ozimops s species  with both short, flat calls in search mode and then steeper curved calls when  contact is made with potential prey.</p>
