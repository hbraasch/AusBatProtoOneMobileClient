<body style='background-color: transparent;'><p><strong>Southern  Free-tailed Bat</strong><br>
  <em>Ozimops  planiceps</em> <br>
(Peters, 1866)</p>
<p><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p>
<p><strong>Description </strong>This is a<strong> medium-sized Ozimops </strong>with a forearm length of 33.8 mm (32.2 to 36.1  mm) and weight of 9.0 g (6.5 to 12.0g). <strong>The  fur on the back is </strong>uniform in colour but varies between individuals  from grey-brown to light brown with a pale base. The <strong>belly fur is paler brown</strong> with a lighter  base and tips. The bare skin of the <strong>face  and wings may be darkly pigmented. </strong>The ears are  triangular and not joined across the top of the head. The head is distinctly  flattened. The most obvious identifying characteristic of this species is only  found in males; <strong>the penis is unusually long (9 to 11 mm)</strong>. </p>
<p><strong>Roost  Habits </strong>These bats roost in tree hollows and the roofs of  houses. One colony was found under the metal cap of a power pole. A study of  roosts showed that colonies of females are fairly large and average 30 to 40  bats, whereas males form smaller colonies of 3 or 4, although up to several  hundred may occur in building roosts. Roosts are often narrow and not much  larger than the bats themselves. They often share these roosts with several  other species including the Little  Broad-nosed Bat, <em>Scotorepens greyii</em>, Chocolate Wattled Bat, <em>Chalinolobus morio</em>, Large Forest Bat, Vespadelus darlingtoni and the Southern Forest Bat, <em>Vespadelus regulus</em><em>.</em> </p>
<p><strong>Habitat </strong>They have been found in a variety of habitats  from tall forests, dry open forest and river red gum <em>Eucalyptus camaldulensis</em>, box-ironwood,  box iron bark and cypress pine woodlands, mallee, Mulga, grassland, coastal  heathlands and chenopod shrublands. They also occur in some suburban areas across  their range. </p>
<p><strong>Diet,  Flight and Foraging&nbsp; </strong>These bats typically forage at or above canopy height and in the  spaces between the trees, along roadways, the outer edge of remnant vegetation  and above the forest canopy. They are rarely observed in large open spaces,  such as paddocks devoid of trees. Although treeless areas are used for  commuting between foraging areas they may be less important for foraging due to  low food abundance. They have also been recorded foraging on the ground, where  they are extremely agile. They have difficulty taking off from the ground and  will usually climb 1 to 2 m before launching. Radio tracking studies have shown  that they forage up to 12 km from their roost. In rural Victoria up to 80% of  the diet was bugs (Hemiptera). These were almost exclusively Rutherglen Bugs, <em>Nysius vinitor, </em>a native species  that is a sporadic agricultural pest. They are widely distributed and one of  the most abundant insects, being available both day and night, and throughout  the year. Bugs are an unusual diet and they are rarely eaten by other bat  species. Other dietary items included flies, beetles, moths, ants, termites and  woodlice. </p>
<p><strong>Vocalisations  and Echolocation calls </strong><br>
  Characteristic  frequency 25 to 31 kHz, flat or curved, often transitioning between the two  call shapes.</p>
