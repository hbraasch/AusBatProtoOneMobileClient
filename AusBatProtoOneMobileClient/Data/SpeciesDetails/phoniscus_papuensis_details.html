  <em>Phoniscus  papuensis </em><br>
(Dobson, 1878)</p>
<p><strong>Description</strong> Considered to be a spider-eating specialist, this bat is distinctively  coloured with <strong>dark brown curly fur with bright golden tips  to each hair</strong>. The <strong>fur  extends along the wings, legs and tail,</strong> with abundant  hair on the tail membrane. The <strong>ears  are distinctly funnel shaped </strong>with a very <strong>long, straight and pointed tragus</strong> with a notch at its base. The <strong>nose  is conspicuously pointed</strong> and overhangs the lower  jaw. The <strong>long, thin upper canines are grooved and fit  into pockets in the lower lip</strong>. The tail is  longer than the combined head and body length and the calcaneum is long, strong  and curved backwards. </p>
<p><strong>Roost  Habits </strong>Although recorded from tree hollows and amongst  leaves and epiphytes the vast majority of roosts have been in the (mostly)  abandoned nests of Yellow-throated Scrub Wrens and Brown Gerygones. These  dome-shaped nests are suspended from thin vines and twigs and made of bark  fibre, moss and lichen. All nests used as roosts had a hole in the base made by  the bat to facilitate entry. Many of the roosts were occupied by single bats,  mainly solitary males. Males also burrow beneath clumps of hanging epiphytic  moss to roost. Bats changed roosts every day or two, with a maximum stay of 4  days. In one study, the average distance between roosts was 350 m. Maternity  colonies of 5 to 20 bats have been recorded and there is at least one instance  where the bats colonised a map hanging up on a verandah. When vegetation  immediately adjacent the mop was cleared, the bats abandoned the mop.</p>
<p><strong>Habitat </strong>Most captures are in rainforest or rainforest sub-storey  with a well developed overstorey of eucalytus or brushbox. The remaining  records are from tall open forest, dry and wet sclerophyll forest, <em>Casuarina </em>dominated riparian forest  and coastal <em>Melaleuca</em> forests. Many of these forests lack a rainforest sub-canopy. Several  individuals have been recorded inside houses on the edge of residential areas. </p>
<p><strong>Diet,  Flight and Foraging </strong>&nbsp;Orb web  spider remains are found in 99% of stomach contents and scat analyses. Small  quantities of beetles, moths and traces of flies, bugs and balls of spider web  are also ingested. Typically these bats forage within a 2 km radius inside  rainforest gullies or cluttered habitat and up the slope into sclerophyll  forest, where web spiders are more common. They avoid the more open areas. Web  building spiders are present year round but they are more common in the wetter  summer months. Spider remains found in the stomach are generally rather intact,  suggesting that the bats may suck the spiders dry before swallowing the soft  abdomen.</p>
<p>The broad wings  and large tail membrane of Golden-tipped Bats allow them to hover and manoeuvre  precisely, their broad-band frequency sweep calls are designed to provide fine  detail and texture. Both are essential traits for finding spider webs in the  dark and plucking out the spiders without getting tangled. </p>
<p><strong>Vocalisations  and Echolocation calls </strong>Steep, near vertical calls,  starting at between 160 and 80 kHz, usually around 120 kHz and dropping to as  low as 40 kHz, usually between 55 and 85 kHz (n = 18). The call is very soft  (low amplitude). </p>
