  <em>Pipistrellus  adamsi</em><br>
Kitchener,  Caputi and Jones, 1986
<p><strong>Description</strong> The fur of this tiny bat shows considerable colour variation <strong>from dark brown to grey brown or rusty red</strong>. The belly is not noticeably lighter than the back. The skin on the  face, ears, forearms and wings varies from light brown to very dark, almost  black. The <strong>ear is broadly rounded</strong> with the tragus about half the length of the ear<strong>.</strong> It has a larger lobe at the base and the rear  edge is more convex than in the Northern Pipistrelle, <em>P. westralis.</em> The wings join  the foot at the base of the fifth digit. The calcar has a <strong>semicircular lobe.</strong> The head of the <strong>glans penis is slightly flared with small  ventral flaps against the shaft.</strong> There is a  relatively <strong>long fleshy lobe, projecting from the  ventral tip</strong>. The <strong>baculum</strong> <strong>is long</strong> with a  narrow base, it is <strong>considerably curved with a deeply forked tip  (30% of length</strong>). In the Top End it differs from the Northern  Pipistrelle, <em>P. westralis</em> by its <strong>broader outer canine width</strong>; <em>P. westralis</em> is 3.4 to 3.8 mm and <em>P.  adamsi </em>is 3.9 to 4.3 mm. This does not hold true in  Queensland where reliance has to be placed on skull features, baculum, habitat  and distribution. </p>
<p><strong>Roost  Habits</strong> Mangrove Pipistrelles most probably roost in  tree hollows. No roosts have been recorded.</p>
<p><strong>Habitat </strong>They are found in monsoon forest, <em>Melaleuca</em> forests, rainforests with  surrounding tall open eucalypt forest, open woodland and along creek and river  systems in savannah woodlands. </p>
<p><strong>Diet,  Flight and Foraging&nbsp; </strong>In the Top End they eat mainly beetles, ants and leaf-hopper bugs as  well as occasional moths, flies, termites, mosquitoes, cockroaches and spiders.  Here their activity pattern differs from other bats in that they become active  latter in the evening, most commonly after midnight (hence the suggested common  name). This may account for the low capture rate of this species in mist nets  that are usually closed by this time. On Cape York Peninsula by contrast they  forage early in the night and can be locally very numerous. When captured  foraging, groups are often predominantly male or predominantly female. They  appear to be most common in areas where there are few <em>Vespadelus</em> species. <br>
  Little is known  of the foraging strategy of this species. It is likely to be a continuous  flight forager feeding on a variety of small insects captured in flight or  gleaned off surfaces, such as foliage within and below the canopy and along the  edges of denser forest types such as monsoon thickets, riverine forest and adjacent  woodland. Where they emerge late and forage in the cooler part of the night  they are thought to rely more heavily on gleaning insects that are resting on  vegetation.</p>
<p><strong>Vocalisations  and Echolocation calls&nbsp; </strong><br>
  The echolocation  call is curvilinear with a characteristic frequency of 43.9 kHz (42.5 to 45.3  kHz) in the Top End. They overlap with <em>P.  westralis </em>above 43.9 kHz. </p>
