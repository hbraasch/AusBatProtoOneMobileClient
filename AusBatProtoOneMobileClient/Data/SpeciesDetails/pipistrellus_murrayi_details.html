<body style='background-color: transparent;'><p><strong>Christmas  Island Pipistrelle</strong><br>
  <em>Pipistrellus  murrayi </em><br>
Andrews, 1900</p>
<p><strong>Description </strong>A <strong>small  species with a forearm of 30 to 33 mm</strong>. The <strong>fur on the back is brown with yellowish tips</strong> and slightly <strong>lighter on the  belly</strong>. The forward upper premolar is visible in a gap  between the canine and rear upper premolar. It is the only insectivorous bat on  Christmas Island. </p>
<p><strong>Habitat </strong>This species inhabited primary rainforest,  terrace rainforest, secondary regrowth and mine rehabilitation areas. One  radio-tagged male was caught in a trap having traveled 2 km in 20 minutes since  leaving its roost. </p>
<p><strong>Roost  Habits </strong>A forest-dwelling bat, all roosts have been  located within primary plateau rainforest. They mostly roosted alone amongst  vegetation 5 to 20 m above the ground, most commonly under the exfoliating bark  of dead canopy trees, but also under flaking fibrous matter on the trunk and  under dead fronds of live <em>Arenga</em> Palms, under dead <em>Pandanus</em> fronds, and under the tangled roots of a Strangler Fig against the  trunk of a canopy tree 5 m above the ground. One male shared its roost with 6  other bats amongst a mass of epiphytic vegetation in a <em>Eugenia grandis</em> tree about 20 m  above the ground. A colony of 47 individuals roosted in a tree hollow in a  large <em>Syzygium nervosum</em> tree 26 m above the ground. There is no information on maternity  roosts or wet season roost patterns. </p>
<p><strong>Diet,  Flight and Foraging&nbsp; </strong>They were recorded to eat predominantly moths (50%), beetles (25%),  ants (22%) with occasional bugs and flies. Thrips and micro-wasps have also  been recorded in their diet. Flight was swift and highly manoeuvrable. They  foraged mostly below the canopy along tracks, around forest edges and small  clearings in primary and secondary forests.<br>

  In the 1980&rsquo;s  these bats were commonly observed flying up to 1.5 hrs before sunset. They were  active until dawn with a peak of activity 45 min after sunset, a cessation of  about 2 hr and then renewed activity until midnight. In the last 20 years there  has been a dramatic shift in their daily activity patterns. In 2004 no bats  were observed or recorded anywhere on the island before sunset and post-dusk  activity was sustained longer into the night. The shift in daily activity has  been gradual and is probably related to the declines in distribution and  abundance</p>
<p><strong>The  species was last seen in August 2009 and is now declared EXTINCT</strong></p>
