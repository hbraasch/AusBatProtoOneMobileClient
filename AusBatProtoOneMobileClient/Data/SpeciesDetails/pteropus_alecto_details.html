<body style='background-color: transparent;'><p><strong>Black  Flying Fox</strong><br>
  <em>Pteropus  alecto </em><br>
Temminck, 1837</p>
<p><strong>Description </strong>A widespread and common bat of northern and  eastern Australia, it is a <strong>large species </strong>with a <strong>forearm length of 153 to 191 mm</strong>. The <strong>fur is black </strong>often with a <strong>reddish brown mantle </strong>on the <strong>back of the neck</strong>. The <strong>black belly fur is sometimes sprinkled with  white tipped hairs</strong> giving a frosted appearance. The <strong>head is black</strong> and some individuals have  faint red-brown eye rings. The <strong>leg is  furred to the knee.</strong> </p>
<p><strong>Roost  Habits</strong> Black Flying Foxes roost in mangroves,  rainforest, bamboo, <em>Melaleuca</em> and monsoon forests as well as remnant bushland in urban areas. Camps  can be quite small and easily overlooked in tropical Australia, or can be large  (30 000 or more) and easily heard from distance away. The same roost site may  be used for many years. In southern Queensland large, reproductively important  camps are formed throughout summer (September to April), after which juveniles  form winter camps locally and adults disperse to distant smaller camps. In the  Top End the wet season (summer) camps are in rainforest and in the dry season  (winter) the bats move only relatively a short distance (100 km), to camp in  bamboo thickets and mangroves, relying on blossom rather than the fruit they  lived on in the wet. Roost sites are sometimes established in cave entrances  with bats moving in as far as 40m to roost on the cave walls (Chillagoe,  Queensland and Tunnel Creek, in Western Australia). </p>
<p><strong>Habitat </strong><em>P. alecto </em>use a wide range  of habitats in tropical and sub-tropical woodlands and appear to be moving increasingly  south along Australia&rsquo;s eastern seaboard into more temperate climes. Rainforest,  monsoon gallery and open forests, as well as urban amenity plantings, provide a  rich source of food when females bear and raise young..</p>
<p><strong>Diet,  Flight and Foraging&nbsp; </strong>Individuals will travel up to fifty kilometres from their camp to  foraging areas but usually remain within a 20 km radius. Their preferred food  is fleshy fruits and the blossoms of eucalypts, <em>Melaleuca</em> and turpentines as well as  a variety of other native and introduced blossoms. They have been seen to eat  the leaves of trees (<em>Albizia</em>) by  chewing the leaves into a bolus, swallowing the liquid and then spitting out  the fibre. This provides the bat with most of the protein and nutrients from  the leaves without the bulk. They often use the same technique for eating  fruit, notably mangoes, spitting out the fibers after extracting the juice. They  have also been observed licking the sap from incisions in eucalypt trees made  by yellow-bellied gliders in north Queensland (S.C.). </p>
<p>Black Flying  Foxes have a sustained flight speed of 25 km per hour. With wind assistance  speeds of 60 kms per hour have been recorded. Bats fitted with satellite  tracking radio-collars have flown across Torres Strait between New Guinea and  Australia, a distance of 150 km. </p>
