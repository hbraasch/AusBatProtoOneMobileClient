<body style='background-color: transparent;'><p><strong>Christmas  Island Flying Fox</strong><br>
  <em>Pteropus  natalis </em><br>
Thomas, 1887</p>
<p><strong>Description  A relatively small flying fox</strong> with <strong>uniform blackish or dark brown fur</strong>, occasionally with a <strong>slightly  paler wash on the back of the neck</strong>. <strong>The fur is peppered with greyish-white hairs</strong>, particularly on the belly. This is the only species of fruit baton Christmas Island.</p>
<p><strong>Roost  Habits </strong>These bats roost in camps of up to several  hundred, but also roost alone or in groups of two or three throughout the  island. All camp sites are located in semi-deciduous rainforest on the coastal  terrace or around the first inland cliff. The population has declined  significantly in recent years. Andrews in 1897 describes them as being so  common as to be a nuisance. In September 1984 there were five well used camps  containing 3700 individuals, Three of these camps were used as maternity camps  and occupied year round. The other two camps were used seasonally by juveniles.  The total population was estimated to be about 6000. In September 2006 the population  was estimated to consist of 1400 bats. Roosting bats are not easy to locate and  earlier in 2006 it had appeared that there were no more than 500 individuals,  with three of the five known camps occupied. The reasons for the overall population  decline are not known. </p>
<p>From the time of  their discovery these bats have been largely diurnal, with the peak activity  period several hours before sunset and briefly again at dawn. This provides  access to diurnal flowers and allows use of the daily wind patterns to commute  from foraging to roosting areas. With their population decline they have become  less diurnal and are now rarely seen prior to two hours before sunset.</p>
<p><strong>Habitat</strong> Being highly mobile, these bats use most of the vegetated habitats  present on Christmas Island. They forage and roost in semi-deciduous rainforest,  evergreen rainforest, mangrove forest, and perennially wet areas. They also  feed in the urban regions and mining areas. In the large areas of regenerating  forest where the rainforest was cleared for phosphate mining, a small South  American tree (<em>Muntingia calabura</em>) was planted widely. It has become a favoured food plant of the flying  foxes and the seeds of this plant have been spread to many areas of disturbed  forest. As <em>Muntingia</em> bears fruit while still quite a small shrub, the flying foxes often seen  feeding in these low bushes very close to the ground were they are caught and  eaten by feral cats. </p>
<p><strong>Diet,  Flight and Foraging&nbsp; </strong>They eat predominantly fruit but will also eat blossom and  occasionally leaves. They are known to feed on over 35 species of plants. The  most common native food items are the fruits or flowers of <em>Barringtonia, Celtis, Dysoxylum, Ficus, Inocarpus, Macaranga,  Maclura, Planchonella, Syzigium, Terminallia</em> and<em> Tristiropsis</em>, as well as  introduced species such as <em>Cocos</em>, <em>Eugenia, Muntingia </em>and<em> Mangifera.</em> </p>
