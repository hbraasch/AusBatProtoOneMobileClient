<body style='background-color: transparent;'><p><strong>Grey-headed  Flying Fox</strong><br>
  <em>Pteropus  poliocephalus </em><br>
Temminck, 1825</p>
<p><strong>Description </strong>This is the only Australian Flying Fox to have a <strong>mantle of rusty brown fur fully encircling the neck</strong>. The <strong>fur on the back is dark grey</strong> although some individuals have a pronounced silver frosting to the  hairs. The <strong>head is covered with light grey fur </strong>and the <strong>belly fur is grey, often with flecks of  white and ginger</strong>. The <strong>fur  extends down the legs and to the toes</strong>. Large males  can attain a body weight of 1100 g and a wingspan of 1500 mm.</p>
<p><strong>Roost  Habits </strong>Grey-headed Flying Foxes will form camps in  almost any dense vegetation greater than 3 m in height. Throughout summer these  camps may be made up of 200 000 individuals or more, depending on local blossom  availability. In winter the young form winter camps while the adults disperse  up to 750 km away. Some adults remain in the winter camps when food is  plentiful. Camps may be shared with Little Red Flying Foxes, <em>P. scapulatus</em>, throughout  their range and with Black Flying Foxes, <em>P.  alecto</em>, in the north. They do not move camp as a unit  but as individuals or small groups. This causes intermixing of the populations across  the whole of their distributional range.</p>
<p>Roosts are also reported  to be segregated by sex and age leading up to the mating season. Mature females  and immatures roost lower down and more towards the periphery than mature males  who establish &lsquo;mating territories&rsquo; in the centre of the colony. At that time, male  territories may hold harems of up to five receptive females, but the more  central, highest-quality males may be joined sequentially by more than 25  females over a single season.</p>
<p><strong>Habitat </strong>This species often roost along watercourses in  stands of native vegetation such as mangrove, rainforest, <em>Melaleuca</em>, <em>Casuarina</em>, or occasionally in introduced  trees. Grey-headed Flying Foxes live much further south than any other megabat  and can tolerate a few degrees of frost, though their recent 450 km extension  of range to the city of Melbourne has depended on the fact that human activity  there has changed the local climate, making it warmer, with less frost and  higher rainfall and humidity. The fact that there are 350 000 street trees  providing abundant food might also be an important factor. There is also recent  evidence that suggests that this species can achieve a degree of torpor,  although further research is required. They have a sophisticated vocal  communication with over 20 situation-specific calls identified. </p>
<p><strong>Diet,  Flight and Foraging&nbsp; </strong>Grey-headed Flying Foxes forage at night at up to 50 km from their  camp. Their diet consists of the fruit, flowers, pollen, nectar, and in rare  cases, leaves of 201 plant species of 50 families. Almost half of these are  Myrtaceae, including their major food source, <em>Eucalyptus </em>blossom. They also eat fruits from a variety of  tree species particularly native figs (<em>Ficus</em>). They have also been found to chew leaves and appear to eat the salt  glands from mangroves. They are known to raid orchards of cultivated fruit, particularly  in years with poor blossom abundance. The availability of foraging resources,  particularly eucalypt blossom is related to rainfall in a highly complex and  still poorly understood way. Spring and summer rainfall is regular in most  years, enabling seasonal breeding but extreme droughts, commonly followed by  periods of well above average rainfall make food supplies unpredictable.  Recently, very large numbers of bats have died during extreme heat events and also  possibly as a result of high intensity, widespread bushfires. </p>
