<body style='background-color: transparent;'><p><strong>Little  Red Flying Fox</strong><br>
  <em>Pteropus  scapulatus </em><br>
Peters, 1862</p>
<p><strong>Distribution</strong> This species occurs from Shark Bay in Western Australia through the  Top End to Queensland and south through New South Wales into northern Victoria.  There are occasional records from South Australia. They occur on many islands  including Melville, Groote, Torres Strait (Thursday, Horn, Badu, Hammond,  Muralug <strong>Boigu</strong>), Palm,  Hinchinbrook and Frazer Islands. This species is more nomadic and has a broader  distribution than other Flying Foxes. It is restricted to Australia although it  has occasionally been reported on the southern coast of Papua New Guinea and  one windblown vagrant was recorded in New Zealand in 1927. </p>
<p>These bats are  known to range a long distance inland depending on the availability of  flowering trees. </p>
<p><strong>Description </strong>A <strong>relatively  small flying fox</strong> with <strong>rich  reddish-brown to light-brown fur</strong> all over its  body, often with a <strong>grey fur on the head</strong>. Some individuals have a yellow patch on the back of the neck and  shoulders. The <strong>legs are sparsely furred or naked.</strong> <strong>Wings are red brown</strong> and <strong>translucent in flight</strong>. There are distinct patches of light creamy brown where the wing  membrane and the shoulder meet. </p>
<p><strong>Roost  Habits </strong>Little Red Flying Foxes are nomads, whose  movements depend on the availability of blossom, a sporadic food resource. They  congregate in large camps of up to one million individuals in early summer. Typically,  they hang close together and their combined weight when in large numbers often  causes severe damage to their roost trees. They commonly share the camps with  other flying foxes. Their camps are more temporary than those of other species  usually only lasting for 4 to 6 weeks, and they frequently camp besides water.  A colony of 200 000 Little Red Flying Foxes was observed to displace resident Grey-headed  and Back Flying Foxes in a permanent camp. They moved into the centre of the  camp and pushed the other species to the edges. They also tended to displace  resident Flying Fox species from local feeding areas. </p>
<p><strong>Habitat </strong>They use a broad range of habitats, from  semi-arid areas to tropical and temperate eucalypt forests, paperbark swamps  and monsoon forests. </p>
<p><strong>Diet,  Flight and Foraging&nbsp; </strong>Little Reds feed predominantly on blossom. All dominant tree and shrub  species within their range are included in the diet. This resource is largely  unpredictable with eucalypt trees producing large amounts of blossom one year  and little the next. The flowering time of many Australian plants is very  variable and largely dependent on climatic conditions. A nomadic lifestyle  enables this bat to utilise this unpredictable food supply. Fruit, sap, and  insects are also eaten, and cultivated fruit is eaten when other food resources  are not available. They sometimes leave their camp before dark and in northern  Australia can be seen foraging during the day during the overcast wet season period.  The flight of this species is direct and of moderate speed. They are not very manoeuvrable  as evidenced by their crash-landings in trees. They are pretty helpless on the ground  and need to climb a tree to become airborne again. In dry years individuals are  commonly found entangled in barbed wire fences or drowned in water tanks in the  western areas of the species range. Loss of habitat from land clearing and  drought conditions will drive them to coastal areas but during wet years they  are able to exploit extensive areas of inland Australia. The extent of their migration varies from year to year in  terms of numbers of animals, the areas they occupy and the composition of the  migrating groups. There is little genetic segregation across the species  distribution, suggestive of a single, large interbreeding population. </p>
