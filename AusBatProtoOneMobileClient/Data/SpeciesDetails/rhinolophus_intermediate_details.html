<body style='background-color: transparent;'><p><strong>Lesser  Queensland Horseshoe Bat </strong><br>
  <em>Rhinolophus  sp.</em><br>
(undescribed  species)</p>
<p><strong>Description</strong> This species has <strong>long, fine, grey  brown fur</strong> peppered with white hairs and a lighter belly.  The nose-leaf, anus and penis or pubic teats are usually grey. The <strong>sella is </strong>5.3 to 5.8 mm wide, <strong>less than two thirds of the horseshoe width.</strong> It has a forearm length of 50.0 to 53.5 mm and ear length 25.2 to  27.3, weight of 8.3 to 9.9 g. </p>
<p>This species  occurs sympatrically with the eastern Horseshoe Bat, <em>R. megaphyllus</em> and the Greater  Queensland Horseshoe Bat <em>R. robertsi</em> over a very restricted distributional range on eastern Cape York  Peninsula. Although the genetic study (Cooper <em>et  al.</em> 1998) failed to resolve the relationships  between the three Australian species they differ significantly in body size,  nose-leaf shape, ear length and echolocation calls. </p>
<p>Sella width and  ear size are excellent features for distinguishing all of the Australian  horseshoe bats. </p>
<p><strong>Roost  Habits </strong>Lesser Queensland Horseshoe Bats have not been  captured at the roost and although they have been caught close to mines it is  not known if they roost in them. Confusion with the Greater Queensland  Horseshoe Bat, <em>R. robertsi</em> that has often been caught in caves and mines has confused the  picture. Of the 10 individuals that we have information on, all were caught in  forest. They may roost in dense vegetation and tree hollows in more humid  locations. </p>
<p><strong>Habitat</strong> Rainforest and gallery forest. </p>
<p><strong>Diet,  Flight and Foraging&nbsp; </strong>A light-tag attached to a male bat in July showed it foraging within  rainforest and around lights at a building in a small clearing. The bat used  only continuous flight foraging to capture prey. When the bat roosted in a tree  between foraging bouts it was either to rest or to consume prey. There was no  evidence of perch hunting. It flew at a height of 0.5 to 2m above the ground,  the flight was slow and fluttery with occasional sudden changes in direction to  capture insects such as moths on the wing. It was also seen to catch an insect  by gleaning from the ground. To reach the building the bat crossed over 200 m  of cleared area. Its flight across the grassland was fast and direct and it did  not forage. </p>
<p><strong>Echolocation</strong> This bat has a constant frequency call of 40 kHz.</p>
