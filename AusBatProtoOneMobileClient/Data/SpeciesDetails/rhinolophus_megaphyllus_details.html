<body style='background-color: transparent;'><p><strong>Eastern  Horseshoe Bat</strong><br>
  <em>Rhinolophus  megaphyllus</em><br>
Gray, 1834</p>
<p><strong>Description</strong> The only Australian Horseshoe Bat to extend its range to outside the  tropics. This bat most commonly has has <strong>greyish  brown fur</strong>, which is slightly lighter on the belly. The fur  has white tips and a grey base and is long and fine. In Queensland there is a  bright rufous form that may be found roosting among grey individuals. The <strong>nose leaves, wings, and ears are pinkish grey</strong>. </p>
<p>It can be  distinguished from other <em>Rhinolophus</em> by its <strong>smaller ears and smaller size</strong>. The <strong>sella </strong>of the  nose-leaf is <strong>less than one-third the width of the  horseshoe</strong>.</p>
<p><strong>Roost  Habits</strong> Eastern Horseshoe Bats are cave dwellers,  inhabiting a wide variety of caves and abandoned mines, but are also found in sea caves, rock piles, buildings, old railway  tunnels, tree roots in undercut creek banks, stormwater drains and culverts. This  species makes use of the widest range of roost sites in the tropics but is more  restricted in southern regions, possibly due to the microclimate restrictions. Colonies  are typically small, less than 20 bats, but females congregate in maternity  colonies of 15 to 2000 bats in spring and summer. A maternity colony of over  10,000 was recently found in a sandstone cave near Sydney. To rear their young  they select warm and humid caves (85 to 95% relative humidity), with little air  circulation. In temperate latitudes these bats disperse in winter and are found  roosting singly in the cooler parts of caves in a torpid state. In the tropics  they are active and forage nightly throughout the year. On Cape York Peninsula,  they have been found in colonies of several hundred to several thousand during  the winter dry season. These are not maternity sites, but large aggregations of  both sexes in non-breeding condition.</p>
<p>When roosting,  they cling to the ceiling by their toes, hanging free with their wings wrapped  around their body. When approached they swivel, often hanging by one leg and  flicking their ears alternately while echolocating to examine what caused the  disturbance.</p>
<p><strong>Habitat</strong> A broad range of habitats are used - tropical and temperate  rainforest, deciduous vine forest, dry and wet sclerophyll forest, open  woodland, coastal scrub and grassland areas. Being adapted to forage in  clutter, they are much more active in mature forests with dense understorey,  and commonly forage along tracks and waterways, avoiding large cleared areas  such as paddocks.</p>
<p><strong>Diet,  Flight and Foraging </strong>&nbsp;They are  well adapted to foraging in cluttered habitats, having short broad wings and  low wing loading, giving them a slow but highly manoeuvrable flight. They often  hover and they are able to manoeuvre successfully among the branches and  foliage of dense shrubs. Both continuous flight and perch hunting are utilised,  prey being captured by aerial pursuit and gleaning. Moths (mainly non-eared  species) are the dominant food. They also eat beetles, flies, crickets, bugs,  cockroaches and wasps. Prey is often taken to a temporary roost to be eaten,  the floor below the roost becoming littered with the discarded wings and </p>

<p><strong>Vocalisations  and Echolocation calls </strong>are a constant  frequency between 66 and 72kHz, typically of long duration with down-sweeping tails  at each end. <strong>&nbsp;</strong></p>
