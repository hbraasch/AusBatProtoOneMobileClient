<body style='background-color: transparent;'><p><strong>Queensland  Horseshoe Bat</strong><br>
  <em>Rhinolophus  robertsi </em><br>
Tate, 1952</p>
<p><strong>Description</strong> An extraordinary looking bat with <strong>enormous  ears and nose-leaf</strong>. It has <strong>long,  fine, grey brown fur</strong> peppered with white hairs and a lighter belly.  The nose-leaf has a <strong>large sella more than two-thirds the width  of the horseshoe.</strong> The nose-leaf, anus and penis or pubic teats may  be either grey or bright yellow. </p>
<p>The <strong>size of this species varies with latitude</strong> (forearm averages 55.8; 52.3 to 59 mm) becoming smaller in the south.  In the northern part of its range (north of Coen) where the three species  overlap in distribution it is considerably larger and heavier with a forearm  length of 56 to 59 mm and ear length of 32.1 to 33.3 mm, weight 11.5 to 16.2 g.  Sella width is a highly reliable diagnostic character.</p>
<p><strong>Roost  Habits</strong> One individual was captured in a disused mine at  Iron Range where it was roosting alone hanging free from the end of a small  ledge on a wall. The roost conditions were 26oC and 78% relative humidity. It was  sharing a roost with several hundred eastern Horseshoe Bats, <em>R. megaphyllus</em>. and could be  distinguished amongst this large colony by its large ears and larger size. A  further 6 were seen in a mine at Mt Amos. They were roosting alone, hanging  from the ceiling, scattered through the mine. The roost conditions were 26.5oC with 98% humidity. The mine was flooded waist  deep in water at the time and contained several thousand, eastern Long-fingered  bats, <em>M. o. oceanensis</em> and several hundred eastern Horseshoe Bats, <em>R. megaphyllus</em>. Eighteen  individuals were collected from this mine (the type locality) in 1950. <br>
  It is likely  that this species also roosts in culverts, under eroded creek banks and in  large hollow eucalypts, but further investigation is required.</p>
<p><strong>Habitat </strong>Greater Queensland Horseshoe Bats have been found  in lowland rainforest, along gallery forest lined creeks within open eucalypt  forest, <em>Melaleuca</em> forest with rainforest understorey, open savannah woodland, tall riparian  woodland of <em>Melaleuca</em>, <em>E. tereticornis</em> and <em>E tesselaris</em> and at the edge of a grassy clearing in the rainforest. </p>
<p><strong>Diet,  Flight and Foraging&nbsp; </strong>Faecal pellets collected from pregnant females in late November  contained predominantly moths and beetles with some grasshoppers and crickets.  These bats foraged using continual flight, not perch hunting. Their flight was  slow and fluttery with sudden changes of direction and height. They flew below  canopy height between 1 and 8 m above the ground within rainforest that grew  both above and along the edge of a road. I have watched this bat catch a large  moth near a light in an open house. It roosted in the dark corner of the room  to eat its meal, discarding the wings before flying out again (S.C.).</p>
<p><strong>Echolocation</strong> <strong>and Vocalisations </strong>The echolocation call of <em>R robertsi</em> is at a constant frequency of 27 to 30 kHz which distinguishes it from other  Rhinolophus species.</p>
