<body style='background-color: transparent;'><p><strong>Orange  Diamond-faced Bat</strong> <br>
  <em>Rhinonicteris  aurantia </em><br>
(Gray, 1845)</p>
<p><strong>Description </strong>One of our most attractive bats! Most individuals are yellowish-cream  to mid golden brown, while variations on this scheme include bats with dark  brown or dark grey dorsal surfaces and creamy white undersides. Often these  bats have dark fur around the eyes. The most reliable character for  identification is the diamond-shaped noseleaf and its foliations. Forearm is  45.2 &ndash; 55.2 mm.<strong></strong></p>
<p><strong>Roost  Habits</strong> Orange Diamond-faced Bats are dependent on caves  and mines with very hot and humid microclimates (28 to 32oC and 96% to  100% relative humidity), during the tropical dry season. Caves and mines with  these conditions are uncommon. These bats roost hanging free from the ceiling  or against the cave wall and separated from each other by 10 to 15 cm. Physiological  and behavioural characteristics explain the dependence on these microclimates: Orange Diamond-faced Bats cannot enter  torpor or maintain body temperature for prolonged periods when exposed to low  temperatures, and individuals do not cluster for warmth. Colony size varies from 5 to over 20,000. Bats leave the all the dry  season roost caves from November to February, during the wet season, when the  outside climatic conditions are similar to the dry season roost microclimate.  They have not been found in caves at this time but are often encountered in  buildings and other similar structures. It is likely that they become forest  dwellers at this time and forage over a much greater range. These bats are very  susceptible to dehydration and hypothermia. Their rates of evaporative water  loss have been found to be more than double that of any other bat. Removed from  the high temperature and humidity of their cave roosts they die within hours.  For this reason, they are difficult to hold in captivity and will die in bat  traps if these are not checked frequently. They are known to abandon roost  caves if disturbed repeatedly.</p>
<p><strong>Pilbara  population </strong>a good deal of research has been done on the  geographically isolated Pilbara population. The main difference between the  populations is that the echolocation call is a higher frequency (121kHz  compared to 114.6kHz for northern bats) and the bats are slightly smaller, but  their morphology and basic biology is the same. Much of this research has been  to examine the effect of Iron-ore mining operations on bat populations and  several new colonies have been found. Monitoring has shown that colonies remain  at their roost cave location in the face of closely adjacent mining operations  as long as the temperature and humidity conditions within the caves remain  unaffected. Like their northern Australian counterparts, Pilbara Orange  Diamond-faced Bats disperse in the wet season when foraging and roosting  opportunities increase and return to the preferred primary roosts during the  dry season. They do not abandon primary roosting caves when the area has been  burnt by fire as long as the local water resource is not affected, and  presumably the local insect populations remain in place at the water resource.  Unlike the Ghost Bat, <em>Macroderma gigas</em> that leave the area and then return as the undergrowth regenerates.  Recent research has shown that even in the harsh conditions of the Pilbara,  they are capable of traveling a long distance between roosts. An individual  marked with a pit tag was later encountered at a roost 170 km away. </p>
<p><strong>Habitat</strong> Orange Diamond-faced Bats are found in monsoon rainforest, tall open  forest, open savannah woodland, black soil grassland and spinifex covered  hills. They are more influenced by the availability of suitable roost caves  than habitat types.</p>
<p><strong>Diet,  Flight and Foraging </strong>&nbsp;They are  opportunistic in their diet, eating primarily moths and beetles throughout the  year but during the wet season they prefer flying termites. The termites  provide a fat rich diet for the pregnant and lactating females. Over the year  their diet comprised of 70% moths, 17% beetles, 8% termites, with occasional  ants, wasps, mantids, lacewings, bugs, flies and cockroaches. They have a rapid  flight (speeds up to 26 km/hr) with a fast wing beat and tend to forage with a  zigzag flight low to the ground. They are often seen flying along roads at  night and their bright orange fur is very distinctive in car headlights.</p>
<p><strong>Vocalisations  and Echolocation calls </strong>are a constant frequency and  in the range of 114 to 121 kHz. </p>
