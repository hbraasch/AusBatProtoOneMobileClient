<body style='background-color: transparent;'><p><strong>Yellow-bellied Sheath-tailed Bat</strong><br>
  <em>Saccolaimus flaviventris </em><br>
(Peters, 1867)</p>
<p><strong>Description</strong> A striking looking bat, it is large, with rich shiny black fur on the back and contrasting bright white, cream or yellow fur on  the belly. Males have a large throat pouch, with a small secondary pouch. There is no pouch in  females, instead there is a naked area and a ridge of skin. There is no wing pouch in either sex. The inner edge of the  tragus is  evenly concave, rounded but with a deep notch just below the top of the outer  edge.</p>
<p>Recent work has shown that it can be difficult to  distinguish from the Naked-rumped Sheath-tailed Bat, <em>S. saccolaimus</em>. However  outer  canine width (OCW) is usually larger (5.9 to 7.1 mm) than in <em>S. saccolaimus</em> (5.0 to 6.2 mm). The length of the  first phalanx of the 3rd digit of the  wing (3P1) may also separate these species (31.7 versus 29.0). </p>
<p><strong>Roost Habits </strong>Yellow-bellied Sheath-tailed Bats  roost in large tree hollows and are often solitary but may be found in  mixed-sex groups of two to six and occasionally large maternity colonies of  over 100. In northern New South Wales they were found to roosting in a live <em>Eucalyptus</em> <em>albens</em> tree that had partially lost its crown and had multiple  dead limbs. The roost was 9 to 10 m above the ground and the entrance hollows  were at the end of rotten tree spouts, where a branch had broken off. The  entrances were about 12 cm in diameter. </p>
<p>They have also been found sharing hollows with Northern  Free-tailed Bats, <em>Chaerephon  jobensis</em> and in the  abandoned nests of Sugar Gliders, <em>Petaurus breviceps</em>. Solitary animals have been found  roosting in animal burrows, in cracks in dry clay and under slabs of rock in  the NT. </p>
<p><strong>Habitat</strong> They occur in almost all habitats; from wet  and dry sclerophyll forest, open woodland, <em>Acacia</em> shrublands, mallee, grasslands and desert. They are only  reported from southern Australia between January and April where they migrate  during the summer. Sick or apparently exhausted animals have occasionally been  found hanging from the outside walls of buildings in broad daylight in Victoria  and South Australia. It is very important not to touch these exhausted or  compromised individuals, as this species is a known vector for Australian Bat  Lyssavirus. </p>
<p><strong>Diet, Flight and Foraging. </strong>They fly fast and straight usually  well above the canopy, but lower over open spaces and at the forest edge. In  pursuit of insects, they are capable of tight lateral turns. They eat  predominantly beetles but also grasshoppers, crickets, leafhoppers. shield  bugs, wasps and a few flying ants. In the Top End they are usually only active  until midnight but they have been recorded foraging all night on Cape York  Peninsula during the wet season. A flight speed of 29km/hr has been recorded  WA. </p>
<p>The conspicuous white belly is easily distinguished at  night with a spotlight, although both <em>S. mixtus</em> and <em>S. saccolaimus</em> can also appear to be very similar. <br>
    <strong>Vocalisations and Echolocation calls &nbsp;</strong>Characteristic  frequency of 17.5 to 22.5 kHz (n = 21). Usually curved in search phase but may  be flat. Often displays harmonics in the 28-33 kHz range and less commonly in  the 9 to 13 kHz range. Occasional non- harmonic pulses within a sequence may  have characteristic frequency as low as 15 kHz or as high as 24 kHz. </p>
