<body style='background-color: transparent;'><p><strong>Papuan  Sheath-tailed Bat</strong><br>
  <em>Saccolaimus  mixtus </em><br>
(Troughton, 1925)</p>
<p><strong>Description</strong> An elusive species that is rarely caught. The fur on the back is made up of a mixture of dark brown and white hairs (60% brown and 40% white) giving an overall  grizzled grey appearance. The belly  fur varies from white to pale buffy brown with a very small scattering  of brown hairs. </p>
<p>Similar species<strong>.  This species is </strong><strong>distinctly smaller</strong><strong> (forearm length 62.0 to 68.0 mm) than</strong> the other two <em>Saccolaimus</em>. There is a well-developed wing  pouch filled with white hairs. There is a strongly developed throat pouch in  males, only slightly less developed in females. The rump is well furred. The tragus is slightly thickened, rounded, with the lower inner  margin concave, sloping gradually upward to form an obliquely  rounded top. Outer canine width is smaller (4.5 to 4.8 mm) than <em>S. saccolaimus</em> (5.0 to 6.2 mm)  and much smaller than <em>S. flaviventris</em> (5.9 to 7.1 mm). The length of the first phalanx of the 3rd digit of the wing (3P1) also separates these  species (23.7 versus 29.0 and 31.7 mm respectively). Although seen foraging  with Yellow-bellied Sheath-tailed Bats there is a difference in their flight  morphology. The aspect ratio of <em>S. mixtus</em> is 9.25 compared to 8.25 for <em>S.  flaviventris</em>, with a wing loading of 13.6 compared to 15.85. This indicates  that Papuan Sheath-tailed Bats probably fly faster and are slightly more manoeuvrable  than yellow-bellied Sheath-tailed Bats. </p>
<p><strong>Roost  Habits</strong> In Australia, Papuan Sheath-tailed Bats roost in  tree hollows. One roost containing several individuals was found in the hollow  spout of a solitary Eucalyptus on a black soil floodplain. The roost was 5 m  above the ground. One specimen in New Guinea was reported to have been captured  in a limestone cave</p>
<p><strong>Habitat</strong> This species occurs in tall open forests particularly <em>Eucalyptus tetradonta</em> forests, low  open woodlands, along creek lines, black soil floodplains and heathlands. </p>
<p><strong>Diet,  Flight and Foraging.</strong> They have been shown to eat mainly beetles (71%)  and large numbers of flying ants (17%) as well as grasshoppers (6%), bugs (4%)  and occasional moths (2%) during the wet season. Little is known of their  flight and foraging habits. They were seen foraging with yellow-bellied  Sheath-tailed Bats high above an isolated homestead where they were feeding on  the large numbers of insects attracted by the lights. When the lights were  turned off at midnight these bats foraged lower and were caught in a mist net  set 10 m above the ground at canopy height. They have also been shot while  foraging along a creekline in semi-open heathland. Other specimens have been  captured in low open eucalypt woodland in bat traps set along tracks at ground  level. </p>
<p><strong>Vocalisations  and Echolocation calls </strong>Characteristic frequency 22-25  kHz with almost-flat to curvilinear and sinuous pulses of variable duration. Not  easily separated from other <em>Saccolaimus </em>species.</p>
