  <em>Saccolaimus  saccolaimus</em> <br>
(Temminck, 1838)</p>
<p><strong>Description</strong> A large, high-flying bat that is rarely caught. It has a forearm  length of 75.7mm (71.9 to 80 mm), weight 50g (31.0 to 64.5 g). The fur colour varies between individuals. On the  back, fur may be brown or dark reddish brown or almost black, usually with white flecks or speckles, at least on the  head and shoulders, although these are absent in juveniles and some  adults. The belly fur is also variable from pure white to grey brown. There is  a throat pouch in males, and females have a well-defined naked area encircled with a cresent-shaped rudimentary pouch ridge. There is no wing pouch. </p>
<p><strong>Similar species</strong>. Some individuals appear almost identical to the Yellow-bellied  Sheath-tailed Bat, <em>S. flaviventris</em> and indeed many specimens have been recently discovered mislabelled  in Museums. The two species can usually be separated by outer canine width. OCW  and presence or absence of white flecking on the fur. If OCW is less than 5.7 mm and/or white flecks are present it is <em>S. saccolaimus</em>. If OCW is greater than 6.0 mm and there is no white flecking it is <em>S. flaviventris</em>. If OCW is between 5.7 and 6.0 mm and there are no white flecks then it can  only be identified by DNA (analysis). Bare-rumped Sheath-tailed Bats are much  larger than the Papuan Sheath-tailed Bat, <em>S.  mixtus, </em>OCW of 4.5 to 4.8 mm, forearm length 64.4mm (61.5  to 68.0 mm), weight 23.3g (21.3 to 26.5 g) which also differs in having wing  pouches. </p>
<p>The name  Bare-rumped Sheath-tailed Bat is based on observations in the literature that  the rump, hind legs and feet are hairless, with the fur stopping abruptly in a  distinct line between the hips. Recent work has shown that the rump is no less  furred than that found in any other Australian sheath-tailed bat. The common  name although inappropriate is used throughout its wide distributional range. <br>

  <strong>Roost  Habits</strong> Bare-rumped Sheath-tailed Bats roost in tree  hollows. Usually large old trees with hollow trunks and/or hollow dead  branches. In Queensland they have been found the hollow trunks and branches of  poplar gums (<em>Eucalyptus platyphylla</em>) in colonies of three to four bats. One colony of ten to 15 bats was  found roosting in the large hollow trunk of a dead Darwin Stringybark (<em>Eucalyptus tetradonta</em>), near Iron  Range. On Magnetic Island in August 2015 a colony of 50 bats were discovered  when a roost tree fell down. The tree containing the roost was a large (~18 m  tall), completely hollow, Moreton Bay Ash (<em>Corymbia  tessellaris</em>) that had been dead for many years, The bats  appeared to only occupy the uppermost four meters of one of the hollow spouts. The  hollow in this section was 12 to 20 cm internal diameter and the entire spout  was 6 m long. </p>
<p>In the Northern  Territory, in April 1996 a colony of about 40, containing adults and large  suckling young were found in a hollow of a large Darwin Woollybut (<em>E. miniata</em>) when it was cut down. In  December 2006, 130 bats were found in a large hollow (25 cm wide) in a Darwin  Stringybark (<em>Eucalyptus tetradonta</em>) that was blown down in a storm. The colony contained adults,  sub-adults, large juveniles and very young juveniles. Roosts have also been  found in Weeping Paperbark (<em>Melaleuca  leucadendron</em>). Colonies size varies from 3 to 130.</p>
<p><strong>Habitat</strong> They have been found in a wide range of habitats from humid to  semi-arid. From rugged sandstone and limestone uplands, ranges and gorges, as  well as volcanic hill country and granite Islands. The vegetation ranges from  tropical rainforest, tropical woodland of Poplar Gum (<em>E. platyphylla</em>) and tall open  forests of Darwin Stringybark (<em>E.  tetradonta</em>) and Darwin Woolybut (<em>E. miniata</em>), gallery forest, <em>Melaeluca</em> swamps, in savannah  woodland, <em>Pandanus</em> woodland  fringing the floodplains, in grassy beach dunes with <em>Melaleuca</em> and <em>Acacia</em> adjacent to open eucalypt  forest, in sandstone plateau country with permanent fresh water, low open  woodland of <em>Eucalyptus cliftoniana</em>,, <em>Owenia vernicosa, Terminalia  ferdinandiana,</em> and <em>Xanthostemon  paradoxu,</em> <em>Melaleuca</em> woodland associated with coastal sand dunes, mangroves, pindan on  sand plains and riparian forests.</p>
<p><strong>Diet,  Flight and Foraging </strong>They feed above the canopy on aerial insects.  They have been observed flying from 80 m above the canopy to within 2 m of the  ground while swooping down to chase prey. They are fast fliers and surprisingly  maneuverable. In Sarawak I (S. Churchill) have watched them leave their roost  in a thatched roof before dark. They dropped from the top of the roof for a  distance of 3 m, before fully opening their wings and swooping up into the sky.  They have been observed foraging within meters of the canopy in riverine  gallery forest and Melaleuca dominated swamps in Queensland. They are known to  fly at altitudes above 400 m and are likely capable of moving long distances.  At Cape Tribulation, North Queensland, they have been identified by their  distinctive echolocation call and then tracked and visually observed commuting  at dusk and dawn from their roost in lowland tropical rainforest, near the top  of a ridge about 150 m above sea level and 1 km inland, to where they were  foraging along a narrow coastal strip. They have been observed flying and  regularly foraging just above canopy height along a 2. km section of mangrove  and littoral forest immediately adjacent to the beach. Foraging bats have been  tracked in another 10 locations from areas just north of Cape Tribulation, to  as far south as the Daintree River, and up to 15 km inland. </p>
<p><strong>Vocalisations  and Echolocation calls</strong><br>
  In Queensland they were found to make high&ndash;pitched calls  at the roost that could be heard over 8 m away. In New Guinea they have been  noted to make a high-pitched audible clicks during echolocation calls while in  flight. <br>
At roosts the species sometimes utters just  audible, high-pitched calls when disturbed (Murphy 2002). The recent discovery of an  alternating duplet or triplet calling pattern used by foraging individuals,  with most energy in the 11- 25 kHz band, is diagnostic for this species.  Further studies show that variations of this same unusual calling pattern are  seen in Australia, Indonesia (Java), Malaysia (Sarawak and Sabah) and Brunei.</p>
<p>Recent studies have found this species to be widespread  throughout the Kimberley of Western Australia. At an overall average frequency  of 20.3 kHz, these sequences (like their NT counterparts), are significantly  different from <em>S. flaviventris</em> and <em>C. jobensis</em> in all spectral  parameters measured, and consistent with (although 2.8 kHz lower than) <em>S.  saccolaimus</em> sequences from Queensland.&nbsp; </p>
