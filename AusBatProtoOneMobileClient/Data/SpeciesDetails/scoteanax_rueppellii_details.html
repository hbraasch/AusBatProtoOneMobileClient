<body style='background-color: transparent;'><p><strong>Greater Broad-nosed Bat</strong><br>
  <em>Scoteanax rueppellii </em><br>
(Peters, 1866) 
<p><em>&nbsp;</em><strong>Description</strong> A bat with an unusual diet, it is large and robust, with a long forearm (51.0 to 56.2 mm). The fur on the back is dark reddish-brown to dark brown, slightly paler on the  belly. It is distinguished from other Broad-nosed Bats by its much larger size.  The ear is  slender and triangular, with a  moderately rounded tip and a notch on the rear edge. The tragus is triangular due to a pronounced lobe midway along  the rear edge; the front edge is straight or slightly concave. The penis is rather hairless. It is most easily confused with the eastern  False Pipistrelle, <em>Falsistrellus  tasmaniensis</em> from which it  can be separated  by the presence of two, not four, upper incisor teeth, there is no gap between the canines and  incisors of <em>S. rueppellii</em> and the ears are shorter, only just touching when pressed  together above the head.</p>
<p><strong>Habitat</strong> They use a variety of habitats including  moist gullies in mature coastal forest, rainforest, open woodland, <em>Melaleuca</em> swamp woodland, wet and dry  sclerophyll forests, cleared paddocks with remnant trees and tree-lined creeks  in open areas. They are found from sea level to an altitude of 1200 m and they  are strongly associated with mild winters and an annual rainfall of over 600  mm. Recently they have been found in high numbers living in old stands of  mangrove forests in the Hunter River estuary. </p>
<p><strong>Roost Habits</strong> Greater Broad-nosed Bats roost in  tree hollows, cracks and fissures in trunks and dead branches, under  exfoliating bark, as well as the roofs of old buildings. One female roosted for  4 days in the hollow spout of a <em>Melaleuca</em> tree 8 m above the ground. B. S. Law  (unpubl. data) located a maternity colony of 90 greater broad-nosed bats (<em>Scoteanax  rueppellii</em>) in a large spotted gum (117cm DBH) </p>
<p><strong>Diet, Flight and Foraging </strong>These large bats have a shallow,  low-frequency frequency-modulated call, high wing loading, and intermediate  aspect ratio, and their flight is characterised by limited manoeuvrability and  moderate speed in open situations. They forage about 5 m from the edge of  isolated trees, forest remnants or along forest crowns with a slow direct flight  pattern. They also use perch hunting, echolocating for passing prey before  flying out to intercept it. Beetles are the dominant prey type with occasional  moths, ants and large flies. Surprisingly spiders are quite commonly eaten with  up to 20% of samples containing spider remains. This is unexpected, given their  wing morphology and loading, and the spiders may be ground dwelling rather than  web building species. <br>
Of most interest is their propensity for eating other  bats in captivity, whenever the opportunity arises. They commonly eat other  bats caught with them in bat traps. They have been recorded eating 9 species of  bats ranging is size from Little Forest Bats, <em>Vespadelus vulturnus,</em> to Southern Blossom Bats, <em>Syconycteris australis</em>. They have been observed to attack  bats in mist nets, particularly juvenile bats and break into adjoining cages to  eat other captive bats. Several researchers have reported them circling closely  when they have been handling and measuring bats. They have also been seen  chasing chocolate Wattled Bats, <em>Chalinolobus morio</em> emerging from their roost at dusk.  It is very likely that bats form part of their diet in the wild. </p>
<p><strong>Vocalisations and Echolocation calls </strong>Characteristic frequency between 32 and 37 kHz (n = 12). Curved,  most pulses lack tail, occasionally with short down-sweeping tail. </p>
