  <em>Scotorepens  balstoni </em><br>
(Thomas,1906)</p>
<p><strong>Description</strong> A common and pugnacious species of inland Australia. It is of  moderate size with a slender body shape. The fur  colour is variable, ranging from dark  brown to a pale sandy colour, most commonly  a light grey-brown on back with a pale brown belly. The fur is markedly bicoloured (unlike the eastern Broad-nosed Bat, <em>S. orion</em>) with paler bases. The  muzzle is broad and square-shaped when viewed from above. The forearm length is moderate but varies geographically increasing from west to east and increasing from south to north. A  large form of this species (previously referred to as <em>Nycticeius influatus</em>) is found in  northern inland Queensland. </p>
<p>The inland  Broad-nosed Bat, <em>S. balstoni</em>, is larger than the  little broad-nosed and northern Broad-nosed Bats, <em>S. greyii</em> and <em>S. sanborni.</em> The ears are relatively slender, and longer than the eastern Broad-nosed Bat, <em>S.  orion</em>. The glans  penis has up to  22 spines on the head in two long rows, this also  distinguishes it from the eastern Broad-nosed Bat, <em>S. orion,</em> that has only 8 spines in a  circular cluster. </p>
<p><strong>Roost  Habits</strong> Inland Broad-nosed Bats roost in tree hollows in  colonies of less than 45. They have been recorded from the roofs of houses,  under the metal caps of power poles and from a length of water pipe. They have  been known to share roosts in houses and tree hollows with Southern Free-tailed  bats, <em>Ozimops planiceps</em> in Victoria. </p>
<p><strong>Habitat</strong> This species is distributed throughout the arid and semi-arid regions  of inland Australia. They can be captured over water and along river red gum  lined waterways, in open woodland, shrublands, mallee and grasslands. </p>
<p><strong>Diet,  Flight and Foraging.</strong> Flight is continuous with sudden rapid  diversions in pursuit of prey. They often start foraging early and are one of  the first species to be caught in mist nets just on dusk. They forage mostly  between trees but also at the edges of forests, and out into open areas. They stay  within 15 m of the ground and do not usually forage above the canopy. Flight  speeds have been recorded from 12 to 21 km/hr. Stomach contents collected from  northern Australia have shown them to eat cockroaches, termites, crickets,  cicadas, bugs, beetles, flies, moths, and ants (mostly wingless species). In  Victoria they eat mainly beetles (45%) and ants, bugs, moths, flies and a few  grasshoppers. </p>
<p><strong>Vocalisations  and Echolocation calls. </strong>Characteristic frequency is  34.1 to 38.7 kHz in Western Australia and 28 to 34 kHz in New South Wales. </p>
