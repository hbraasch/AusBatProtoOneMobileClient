<body style='background-color: transparent;'><p><strong>Little Broad-nosed Bat</strong><br>
  <em>Scotorepens greyii </em><br>
(Gray, 1843) </p>
<p><strong>Description</strong> Abundant in the north, this species has a  small, slender body shape. The fur is markedly bicoloured. Fur colour is variable from brown to  grey-brown on the back  with the base of the  hairs lighter than the tips,  the belly fur  is lighter. The forearm is small (27.3 to 35.0 mm) Ears are relatively broad and the tragus has a narrow and pointed  tip. Forearm length  increases from east to west and from north to south (the opposite to <em>S. sanborni</em>). The glans penis has up to 10  spines on the head, mainly in two long rows. </p>
<p>It is almost impossible to separate in the field from the northern Broad-nosed Bat, <em>S. sanborni,</em> where their ranges overlap in the Kimberley and western Top End  although specimens can be separated by examination and measurement of the skull  and by plotting braincase width against palatal length (see Kitchener and  Caputi 1985). In these areas genetic analysis is the only reliable method of  identification of live animals. Where their ranges overlap in Queensland the  northern Broad-nosed Bat, <em>S. sanborni</em> (forearm length 33.3 mm, 31 to 35.8 mm) is averages  larger than the little Broad-nosed Bat, <em>S. greyii</em> where the most reliable means of  identification is via echolocation call frequency. </p>
<p><strong>Roost Habits</strong> Little Broad-nosed Bats roost in  hollows, usually in trees but the hollow centres of fence posts and even the  space under the metal topping caps of telegraph poles are accepted. They will  also roost in disused buildings. Colonies of 2 to 20 bats have been found.  Although a common species little has been recorded of its natural history.</p>
<p><strong>Habitat</strong> they are found in monsoon forest, <em>Melaleuca</em> forest, tall open forest, open  forest, open woodland, mulga shrublands, mixed shrubland, escarpment, river red  gum lined watercourses,<em> Pandanus</em> and grasslands. They are commonly caught near water. Dry  grassland, woodland, sandy deserts, inland rivers, monsoon forest, paperbark  swamps. Roost in tree hollows, buildings, under telegraph pole caps and inside  hollow fence posts.</p>
<p><strong>Diet, Flight and Foraging. </strong>&nbsp;This species is a continuous flight forager  that has a moderately fast, agile flight. They primarily search for insects  close to the tree tops but not above them, flying in the open spaces along the  contour of the vegetation within 2 meters of the foliage. They also forage over  water, grasslands and other open habitat. Flight is characterised by abrupt  horizontal turns where the bat rolls to near vertical bank angles. They eat  large numbers of beetles, bugs and ants with occasional moths, termites,  cockroaches, katydids, crickets, bugs, flies and lacewings. The high proportion  of flightless insects such as ants in the diet indicates that they may glean  food from foliage and other surfaces. Michael Pennay has watched these bats  near Bourke in New South Wales, dog-fighting and catching moths almost as large  as themselves. They are tenacious bats with a surprisingly strong bite.&nbsp; A flight speed of 22km/hr recorded in WA. <br>
    <strong>Vocalisations and Echolocation calls &nbsp;</strong>Characteristic  frequency between 35 and 41.5 kHz (n = 14). Curved, tail usually up-sweeping  but may be down-sweeping or absent in some pulses. Sometimes gives flatter  pulses. </p>
