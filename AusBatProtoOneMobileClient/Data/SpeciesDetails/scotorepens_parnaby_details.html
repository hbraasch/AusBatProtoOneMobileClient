<body style='background-color: transparent;'><p><strong>Parnaby&rsquo;s  Broad-nosed Bat</strong><br>
  <em>Scotorepens  species </em>(Parnaby)<br>
(undescribed)</p>
<p><strong>Description </strong>Fur colour is brown  with a bi-coloured pale  belly. In some areas of New South Wales, it coexists  with both <em>S. greyii</em> and <em>S. orion</em>. In  south-eastern Queensland it occurs with <em>S.  greyii</em> and <em>S.  balstoni</em>. Although ranges of measurements and weights  overlap between these species, live animals from the same area are recognisably  distinct</p>
<p>The fur is paler than <em>S  orion</em>, and the muzzle  is less pug-like. This species is of intermediate body size for the genus,  with a mean forearm length of 32.8 mm (31.0 to 34.6) averaging larger than <em>S.  greyii</em><em>,</em> 31.3 mm (27.3  to 35.0) and smaller than both <em>S. orion</em><em>,</em> 35.1 mm (32.4 to 38.8) and <em>S. balstoni</em><em>,</em> 35.6 mm (32.0 to 40.5). Body is less robust, average weight of 7.4 g  (6.1 to 9.0), than <em>S. orion </em>9.3 g (7.0 to 14.1) and <em>S.  balstoni</em> 9.3 g (6.3 to 12.7), and slightly larger than <em>S. greyii.</em> Ratio of tibia to forearm  length is usually greater than .41 in <em>Scotorepens  sp.</em> compared to less than .41 for <em>S. orion,</em> but both <em>S. greyii</em> and <em>S. balstoni</em> have ratios that range  above and below this figure. </p>
<p>This species  differs on skull, dental and external morphology from <em>S. balstoni</em> and <em>S. orion</em> and differs from <em>S. greyii</em> on skull morphology. The  details are yet to be published.</p>
<p><strong>Roost  Habits</strong> An individual was captured and radio-tracked in  dry sclerophyll forest on the New South Wales coast. The roost was found in a  mature swamp mahogany tree (<em>Eucalyptus  robusta</em>) over 100 cm in diameter. The bat was roosting  in a hollow branch about 20 m above the ground. They have also been found  roosting in buildings, in wall cavities, between floor joists and in an attic.</p>
<p><strong>Habitat</strong> Occurs in drier forest types east of the Dividing Range south to the  Hunter Valley. It is relatively common west of the Dividing Range in dry open  eucalypt woodland and forest and brigalow-belah forests. It has been recorded  from <em>Eucalyptus pilligaensis</em> woodland with open <em>Allocasuarina</em> and <em>Callitris</em>; and open forest of <em>Corymbia  citriodora</em> and ironbark with scattered <em>Callitris.</em> </p>
<p><strong>Diet,  Flight and Foraging. </strong>The central-eastern Broad-nosed Bat has a  relatively fast flight and forages by aerial pursuit above the canopy or within  the sub-canopy. Nothing is known of its diet.</p>
<p><strong>Vocalisations  and Echolocation calls.</strong> Difficult to distinguish  from the little Broad-nosed Bat, <em>S.  greyii. </em>Characteristic frequency between 38 and 41 kHz (n  = 22). Curved, tail usually up-sweeping.</p>
