  <em>Setirostris eleryi </em><br>
(Reardon and McKenzie 2008)<strong></strong></p>
<p><strong>Description</strong> The Bristle-faced Free-tailed Bat is a  small, lightly built species, weighing 5.1 g (4.0 to 6.0 g), with a forearm  length of 33.6 mm (31.5 to 35.9 mm). It has a long thin face with about 30 scattered dark  bristles and a fringe of fur around the top  lip. The muzzle is  much narrower than <em>Ozimops</em> species with an OCW of 3.5 mm (3.0  to 3.8 mm), the face tapers rapidly to the enlarged nostrils. The chin falls  well short of the snout. There is no throat (gular) sac in either sex. The ears  are triangular in shape and with the anterior edge straight. The ears are not  joined across the forehead but separated by a gap about 2 mm. There is a small  antitragus and the tragus is rounded. The fur is brownish grey to pale sandy,  to reddish brown on the back with the bases to the fur darker grey and with  very light frosting on the tips. The fur on the belly is pale cream to white.  Toes each have three long hairs extending at least the length of the toes. Both  males and females have a long slander fleshy finger-like projection arising from the  genitals. (This feature  is also found in the East-coast  Free-tailed Bat, <em>Micronomus  norfolkensis</em>). In males it arises from the tip of  the dorsal surface or foreskin of the penis and is almost as long as the penis.  In females it arises from the upper edge of the genital opening. There are  hairs along the projection with several hairs extending well beyond the tip.  Males also possess penis is that is flattened and is acutely pointed at the  tip. The glans penis is unique in having serrated lateral flanges,with the  serrated flanges becoming wider at the base.</p>
<p><strong>Roost Habits</strong> A radio tracking study in New South  Wales found several roosts in eucalypts (<em>Eucalyptu</em>s<em> populnea</em> and <em>E intertexta</em>) amongst the fringing vegetation of  a dry creek. The roosts were in trunk and branch hollows with entrances only  just big enough for one bat to squeeze through (1.3 to 2 cm) at a height of 3  to 6 m above the ground. One roost contained a maternity colony of 15 lactating  females. The two males roosted in colonies of 4 and 20 bats (including bats of  other species). Roosts were 3.2 to 4 km from the capture sites and two roosts  were used on consecutive nights.</p>
<p><strong>Habitat</strong> Habitats include open forests of Bimbil Box (<em>Eucalyptus</em> <em>populnea</em>), Belah (<em>Casuarina pauper</em>) and Coolibah (<em>Eucalyptus coolibah</em>) open woodland,  River Red gum (<em>Eucalyptus</em> <em>camaldulensis</em>) lined watercourses, Mulga and  hummock grasslands. Also with <em>E. polyanthemos</em>, <em>E. melanophoia</em> and <em>Corymbia citriodora</em> in woodlands and forest in the  eastern part of the distribution. They have been captured in mist nets and bat  traps along ephemeral watercourses and floodways, over dams and waterholes, one  was found drowned in a swimming pool. </p>
<p><strong>Diet, Flight and Foraging. </strong>The Bristle-faced Free-tailed Bat has  a distinctive flight pattern. Their relatively long narrow wings  suggest straight high speed flight but the bats were observed to use a more  agile foraging strategy with most foraging relatively close to the ground and  near vegetation. Flight was relatively slow, fluttery, and below canopy height  at around 3 to 4 metres elevation. They flew in loose circles with occasional  rapid changes in height and direction in pursuit of prey. </p>
<p>Although considerably less agile than the Little Broad-nosed Bat, <em>Scotorepens greyii </em>and Gould's Wattled Bat, <em>Chalinolobus gouldii</em>. In energy terms, it hunts and  commutes more economically than either species because of its above-average  aspect ratio (7.8) and features of its aerodynamics. The restricted agility  implies that <em>S. eleryi</em> must detect its prey at a greater  distance than the two vespertilionid bats. It is likely that, rather than  increasing its echolocation call pulse intensity, and therefore its food requirements, <em>S. eleryi</em> tunes its search-mode pulses more  finely to gain the extra detection range. They are optimised to hunt in  semi-cluttered air spaces, can commute long distances between insect patches  cheaply and it can use flat-wing aerodynamics to reduce profile drag in  high-speed flight. Its call repetition rates imply that it has a steady level  foraging-flight speed of 23 km per hour. Their diet has not been recorded. </p>
<p><strong>Vocalisations and Echolocation calls.</strong> The echolocation call differs from all Australian  Mormopterus species calls by having strongly frequency modulated search phase  pulses shaped like a reverse &lsquo;J&rsquo; compared with more flat shaped pulses of all  other Molossid species and is more like a Vespertilionid call. The call of <em>S.  el</em>eryi has a characteristic frequency of 37kHz. </p>
