<body style='background-color: transparent;'><p><strong>Southern  Blossom Bat</strong><br>
  <em>Syconycteris  australis</em><br>
(Peters, 1867)</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Description</strong> Like a miniature Flying Fox, its fur is  fawn to reddish-brown, slightly lighter on the belly. It has large eyes and a long  thin muzzle with raised nostrils, and a very long brush-tipped tongue. It is small  with a forearm 40.9 (38.6 to 42.8) mm and weight 18.0 (13.7 to 23.0) grams. </p>
<p>It is only  slightly larger and very similar to the Least  Blossom Bat, <em>Macroglossus  minimus,</em> but differs in having the outer pair of lower incisor teeth larger  than the inner pair with no gap between them and lacking the skin flaps along the inside of the legs. There is a strip of long fur in this area instead and there is no  tail. Males lack the large scent gland found on the chest of Least Blossom Bats<em>.</em> Individuals in New South Wales are considerably  heavier than those in north Queensland. </p>
<p><strong>Roost  Habits</strong> They roost most commonly in rainforest, most  commonly in the sub-canopy but occasionally in the canopy. Roosts are amongst  large leaves (sometimes dead), often on the growing tips of saplings or amongst  dense vines. They roost with their wings wrapped around them and look like a  cluster of dead leaves. the illusion is enhanced by the bats habit of  occasionally rocking from side to side as if the wind has disturbed them. They  also roost in wet sclerophyll forests where their favoured roosts were in  cabbage palm leaves (<em>Livistonia australis</em>). They usually select a different roost every night but stay in the  same vicinity (within 50 m) for the season. During the winter they roost near  the forest edge, but in summer they select roosts deep within the forest where  it is cooler. They have a high energy demands and tend to enter torpor most  days. </p>
<p><strong>Habitat</strong> They are found from sea level to about 3,000 m. In northern New South  Wales, the combination of heathland and coastal rainforest is essential for  this species. They have a foraging area of about 13 ha of heathland and use the  same area each night. Further north along the Queensland coast they live in  rainforest, wet sclerophyll, monsoon and <em>Melaleuca</em> forests. </p>
<p><strong>Diet,  Flight and Foraging.</strong> They are specialist nectar and pollen feeders.  Their tongues are long and covered in rows of papillae which increases the  surface area and acts like a nectar absorbing mop. Pollen is a valuable food  resource but is only eaten when they groom it from their fur and wings after  nectar feeding. Microscopic examination of their fur reveals pollen-trapping  scales on their hairs. In New South Wales they feed predominantly on <em>Banksia</em> and<em> Callistemon</em> nectar and  pollen, no fruits or insects being eaten. In northern Queensland they eat <em>Melaleuca</em>, <em>Banksia</em>, <em>Grevillea</em> and <em>Eucalyptus</em> blossom as well as the  nectar of many rainforest plants, particularly the cauliflorous <em>Syzigium</em>. These bats are good  pollinators as they carry considerably more pollen than either birds or insects  and it often flies directly between flowering trees. They will fly up to 6 km  over cleared paddocks and may be a vital disperser of pollen to isolated fragments  of tropical rainforest. They tend to eat more fruit, particularly figs, in the  northern areas. Fig seeds particularly from <em>Ficus  variagata</em>, <em>F.  congesta</em> and <em>F.  racemoca</em> as well as seeds of <em>Timonius</em> and Climbing Pandan,  Freycineta<em> spp</em> are  frequently found in the faeces. <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <br>
  They are  opportunistic feeders and can appear in large numbers at a briefly flowering  tree. Marked bats have returned to feeding sites over several years. They  remain actively foraging for nearly half the night before returning to their  day roost shortly before dawn. They are influenced by the brightness of the  moon and bats will delay departure by up to 4 hours on strongly moonlit nights.  They actively forage for most of the night and continue to forage during the  rain. </p>
