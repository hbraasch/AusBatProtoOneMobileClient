<p><strong>Coastal Sheath-tailed Bat</strong><br />
<em>Taphozous australis</em></p>
<p>(Gould, 1854)</p>
<p><strong>Description</strong> A bat of coastal caves, with pale grey to brown  fur,  being <strong>slightly lighter on the belly.</strong> The bases of the hairs are whitish. Both light brown and grey-brown colour forms have been noted within the one colony. <strong>Males have a distinct throat pouch</strong>, and this is represented by a <strong>rudimentary pouch ridge in females</strong>. A <strong>metacarpal wing pouch is present </strong>near the wrist.</p>
<p><strong>Roost Habits. </strong>Coastal Sheath-tailed Bats roost in sea caves, boulder piles, rock fissures, disused mines, old World War II  concrete bunkers, even occasionally in buildings. They are usually in colonies of 2 to 25, but up to 100 have been recorded. They generally roost in shallow caves, within the twilight zone, but will sometimes move to the darker parts of larger caves and mines.</p>
<p>They roost on near vertical rock faces, usually in airy, boulder sea caves with multiple entrances, located on rocky foreshores. When disturbed in their roost caves, the bats typically give an audible chirp as they leave and will fly out in daylight to another cave nearby. In the northern part of their range they roost in conditions of moderate temperature and relatively high humidity (26.5 to 29oC and 84% to 92% humidity) and the bats space themselves about 20 cm apart.</p>
<p><strong>Habitat.</strong> They forage in open eucalypt forest, grasslands, coastal heath lands, sand dune scrub, monsoon forests, mangroves and paperbark swamps <em>Melaleuca ericifolia</em>, all within a short distance from the sea. From sea level to about 300m.</p>
<p><strong>Diet, Flight and Foraging. </strong>They feed on beetles and other insects, sometimes returning to the roost to eat their prey. Large beetles are often taken to a night feeding roost or back to the day roost, leaving remains discarded below the roost. They forage above the canopy. Their flight is fast and direct with a rapid change in direction to capture prey. They are found on many of the Queensland coastal islands and I (S.C.) have seen them fly across from Albany Island to the mainland at dusk to forage. Even though one bat was recorded traveling a distance of ~15km from its roost site, all foraging was within 3 km of the coast, confirming previous speculations that this species is confined to the coast. <em>T. australis</em> was also observed, on several occasions, taking advantage of insect aggregations attracted by artificial lights located in urban areas adjacent to remnant vegetation. </p>
<p>As with other <em>Taphozous</em>, <em>T. australis</em> are difficult to catch in mist nets or harp traps except at the cave entrance, and the use of bat detectors is also limited as their calls cannot be distinguished from <em>T. troughtoni</em> or <em>O. lumsdenae</em>. <em>Taphozous australis. </em>They are most commonly surveyed by searching for roosts. Colonies of <em>T. australis</em> are largely undetectable during the winter months along the central Queensland coast and so surveys targeting this species are best conducted during warmer months from September to April</p>
<p><strong>Vocalisations and Echolocation.</strong>Their echolocation call is flat to slightly sloped and its characteristic frequency ranges from 23 to 27 kHz. The echolocation calls are difficult to distinguish from Troughton's Sheath-tailed Bat, <em>Taphozous troughtoni, </em>and Northern Free-tail Bat, <em>Ozimops lumsdenae.</em></p>
