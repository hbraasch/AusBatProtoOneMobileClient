<p><strong>Common Sheath-tailed Bat<br />
</strong><em>T</em><em>aphozous georgianus </em></p>
<p>(Thomas, 1915)</p>
<p><strong>Description</strong> . This Sheath-tailed Bat is a medium sized species with an average forearm length of 67.9 (61.7 to 73.1 mm). The throat pouch is absent in both sexes. A wing pouch is present. The fur is light charcoal grey on the back but slightly brownish on the rump and can be highly variable, from grey to various shades of brown.. The fur on the belly is often brownish. The grey wings have a translucent quality and a sticky feel. The outer margin of the tragus is concave on the upper half.</p>
<p><strong>Roost Habits. </strong>Common Sheath-tailed Bats are cave dwellers, usually found in the twilight zone near the cave entrance. They prefer to roost fairly high above the ground on vertical walls so they can gain more speed as they drop to become airborne. They show a preference for boulder piles and split caves but are also found in abandoned mines and caverns (preferring those with multiple entrances). They are also found in more exposed areas such as rock overhangs. Colony size varies from 1 to 50 (one colony of 260 reported) but is most commonly 4 to 10. Individuals may use several caves, regularly moving from one to another and are known to vacate a cave for a considerable part of the year. Their roost microclimate varies considerably in the Top End ranging from 21 to 33oC with 20% to 100% humidity. Clusters of pregnant females (maternity colonies) have been found roosting deeper in caves and mines, beyond the twilight zone, in areas where conditions are more humid and generally warmer. They are often found co-habiting with <em>Vespadelus finlaysoni</em>. </p>
<p><strong>Habitat.</strong> They can be found in monsoon forest, paperbark forest, tall open forest, open woodland, deciduous vine forest, spinifex and hummock grasslands. The distribution is likely to be related to the availability of rocky outcrops and caves for roost sites.</p>
<p><strong>Diet, Flight and Foraging.</strong> Common Sheath-tailed Bats use fast semi-agile flight with steep turns to catch insects in open airspaces. They frequently use tight lateral turns, rolling to steep bank angles (more than 60<sup>o</sup>) to catch prey and  often forage along the tops of escarpments and along gullies in hill country, over a variety of vegetation types and over pools and creeks, but are not known to drink. Level open air speeds of 26 km/hr and up to 36 km/hr in a descent have been recorded. Speeds are as low as 16 km/hr during abrupt maneuvers to catch insects.  They are reported to eat mainly beetles, but also bugs, grasshoppers, ants as well as occasional moths, lacewings and spiders.</p>
<p><strong>Vocalisations and Echolocation.</strong> Calls are typically long and straight or slightly curved and almost a constant frequency.  When recording reference calls from hand released individuals,  initially the pulse shape is curved, however call shape changes when in normal &ldquo;search mode&rdquo; flight. Taphozous, Chaerephon and Saccolaimus all produce relatively low frequency echolocation calls that travel longer distances than higher frequency calls (Woodside and Taylor, 1985). This may allow them to fly faster than most other species by having the capability to detect and avoid obstacles that are far ahead (Churchill, 1998). As a consequence of this signal system, these species tend to forage in open space.</p>
