<p><strong>Hill's Sheath-tailed Bat</strong><br />
  <em>Taphozous hilli </em></p>
<p>(Kitchener, 1980)</p>
<p><strong>Description.</strong> A widespread species of the inland areas. Dorsal pelage is often grey-brown, belly fur not distinctly lighter but bicoloured, being lighter at the base, although extreme variation is evident, with individuals sometimes having pale yellow-brown heads and body colours that range from yellow-brown to brown to dark grey. Thus, as with T. georgianus and T. troughtoni, fur colour is not a reliable character for identification. Forearm length 60.4 to 71.7 mm. A throat pouch is present in males and represented by a rudimentary edge and bare patch in females. A metacarpal wing pouch is present.The depth of the throat (or gular) pouch in Male <em>T hilli</em> is correlated with their reproductive condition and the pouch may play some role in male social behaviour (reread Kitchener 1976).&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Roost Habits.</strong> Hill's Sheath-tailed Bats are cave dwelling, usually living in groups of 2 to 10 in the twilight zones of open caves, rock splits, disused mines, rock overhangs and boulder piles. These sites offer little constancy of microclimate with humidities of 8% to 25% being common. They normally roost well separated from each other. I have found them forming maternity colonies in September (S.C.). These were located in the dark part of the caves and had a temperature of 20 to 24oC and 40% to 78% relative humidity. The heavily pregnant females were extremely reluctant or possibly unable to fly. All these bats were placid, with slow movements, although they were alert and warm to touch (they were not torpid). Many of the pregnant females were roosting in tiny crevices and some were seen to burrow between loose stones on the floor of the cave. Males were also roosting in these caves but closer to the entrance and would readily fly when approached. </p>
<p><strong>Habitat.</strong> Hill's Sheath-tailed Bats are common in arid areas of Australia. They can be found in eucalypt woodlands, open plains, spinifex grasslands and <em>Acacia</em> shrublands and distribution may be restricted by the availability of rocky habitats with crevices and caves or areas with abandoned mines. They may be found a considerable distance from permanent water. In the Simpson Desert they were found to forage mostly around rocky outcrops, over open plains and dry creek beds. They did not forage at either the temporary or permanent water holes and Taphozous have never been known to be trapped over water. </p>
<p><strong>Diet, Flight and Foraging.</strong> Their diet has not been examined, but beetle remains have been found beneath their roost. The leave the roost well after dark to forage. Their flight is similar to other <em>Taphozous</em> being relatively fast and direct. This species forages above the canopy of riverine woodland <em>Acacia</em> shrubland. Foraging habitats include open airspace more than 5m above or beside tree canopies, cliffs, hill-slopes or hilltops and semi-open airspaces a few metres above the top of bare hills. </p>
