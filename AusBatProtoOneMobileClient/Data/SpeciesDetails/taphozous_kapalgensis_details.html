<p><strong>Arnhem Sheath-tailed Bat</strong><br />
  <em>Taphozous kapalgensis</em></p>
<p>(McKean and Friend, 1979)</p>
<p>Description This rare and little known species is a small <em>Taphozous</em> with a forearm length of 58 to 64 mm. There is a throat pouch in males, and in females, is represented by a rudimentary ridge. A metacarpal wing pouch is present. The fur is a beautiful pale orange brown on the back and paler grey on the belly. A band of long white hair extends over the ventral surface of the wings along the sides of the body forming two distinct white lateral stripes that are visible in flight. These lateral white stripes were not present on an 18.5 gram sub-adult male collected at the same time as an adult male and female that possessed well developed stripes.</p>
<p><strong>Roost Habits</strong> The roost habits of this bat have not been recorded. Arnhem Sheath-tailed Bats are most likely to roost in tree hollows as most of the records have been a long distance from caves or rocky areas. An observation of this species roosting in a mine in southern Kakadu is based on a sighting and is probably incorrect. The mine contains a population of <em>T. georgianus</em>.</p>
<p><strong>Habitat</strong> This species has been collected, mostly by shooting, in sedge land and coastal floodplain adjacent to <em>Pandanus spiralis</em> woodland with nearby small patches of monsoon forests, in tall open forests, in paperbark swamps and open woodland. The only specimen ever caught in a bat trap was taken in a track corridor in monsoon galley forest adjacent a floodplain area in Kakadu National Park (pers. comm. Dennis Matthews). Further habitat prefernces, as determined from  echolocation calls, include cleared areas, mangroves, tall coastal eucalypt woodland of <em>Eucalyptus tectifera</em> and <em>E. miniata</em>, <em>Pandanus spiralis</em> mixed woodland adjacent to floodplains, open woodland, open floodplain grassland with scattered <em>Bauhinia,</em> and grassy coastal dunes with patchy monsoon forest and <em>Acacia</em> regrowth.</p>
<p><strong>Diet, Flight and Foraging. </strong>They fly above the canopy in forests but come lower when feeding over open areas or along unobstructed flyways usually between 10 and 20 m above the ground. These bats fly rapidly with abrupt changes in direction and emit a succession of loud shrill calls. Three stomach contents that were examind, contained almost entirely field crickets (Gryllidae) (96%), with traces of beetles and moths.</p>
<p><strong>Vocalisations and Echolocation. </strong>Recently they have been found to have a distinctive echolocation call and this has been used to help define the distribution of the species. The echolocation call is 23 to 25.5 kHz and of very short duration (3 to 7 ms).<strong> </strong>Characteristic frequency 23.6 kHz. </p>
