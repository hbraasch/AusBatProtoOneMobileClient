<p><strong>Troughton's Sheath-tailed Bat</strong><br />
  <em>Taphozous troughtoni</em></p>
<p>(Tate, 1952)</p>
<p><strong>Description.</strong> It is a large species with a forearm length of  67.2 to 75.9 mm. The throat pouch is absent in both sexes. Mtacarplal wing pouch present. The fur is generally brown with pale grey guard hairs with no difference between back and belly fur colour, although colour can be highly variable and should not be used as a guide to identification.. The large skull is distinctive with the sagittal and lambdoidal crests sharply edged.</p>
<p><strong>Roost Habits.</strong> Troughton&rsquo;s Sheath-tailed Bats are cave-dwelling. They generally roost in shallow caves or the twilight zone of larger ones, frequently near narrow crevices into which they retreat when alarmed. They roost in natural caves, rock crevices, boulder piles and abandoned mines. There is little difference between microclimate conditions inside or outside the roost. Most roost caves are occupied by less than 20 individuals although one colony contained 100 bats. Each bat uses several caves and they have been observed to move 12 km to alternate roosts. They are known to give birth in their normal twilight zone roosts but have also been observed to use dark and humid caves for maternity sites. Individuals are well spaced at the roost, only rarely are 2 to 3 bats seen in close contact. One male was observed to vigorously defend his personal roost area from other bats attempting to alight nearby.</p>
<p><strong>Habitat.</strong> A wide variety of habitats including wet and dry sclerophyll forests, open woodland, mulga shrublands, spinifex covered hills, and grasslands, where there are rocky areas, caves or mines. </p>
<p><strong>Diet, Flight and Foraging. </strong>A radio-tracked individual at Chillagoe hunted aerial insects in an area about two kms from its roost cave. Starting 30 minutes after sunset it foraged continuously for 5 hours, rested for 3 hours in a group of boulders and foraged briefly again before returning to its cave at dawn. Their diet has not been examined but they are presumed to feed mainly on beetles. At the southern extremes of their range, there is a marked seasonal variation in body weight due to fat deposits. They are heaviest in April and lightest in September. In mid-winter they conserve energy during the day by allowing their body temperature to drop.</p>
<p><strong>Vocalisations and Echolocation. </strong>Calls can  be perfectly flat when in true search phase, but also sloped. Characteristic frequency 22 to 25 kHz (n = 17). </p>
