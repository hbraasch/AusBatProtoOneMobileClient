<p><strong>Northern Cave Bat</strong><br />
  <em>Vespadelus caurinus</em></p>
<p>(Thomas, 1914)</p>
<p><strong>Description. </strong>&nbsp;A small cave species with brown fur on back and belly, only slightly paler on belly. The fur has a dark-brown, almost black, base; just the tips are brown. The skin on the face, wings and forearms is dark, almost black. The head of the glans penis is laterally compressed; the urethra covered by an upward projecting narrow tongue of skin from the ventral tip. The dorsal surface has a deep longitudinal groove.</p>
<p><strong>Roost Habits. </strong>These are cave bats that tend to roost in small cracks and crevices, near the entrances of caves and mines. Colony size averages 8 to 20 but ranges from solitary animals to groups of 45. Their roost microclimate reflects the ambient conditions and is very variable with temperatures ranging from 20oC to 34.5oC and 23% to 98% relative humidity. Females with young have a more restricted microclimate, preferring to roost in temperatures of 28.5oC to 34.5oC and 25% to 62% humidity. They are found in a variety of roosts including volcanic, sandstone and limestone caves, boulder piles and crevices, disused mines, road culverts, concrete bridges and fairy martin nests. They will also use buildings, particularly under elevated houses. .</p>
<p><strong>Habitat. </strong>&nbsp;Northern Cave Bats predominantly occur in or adjacent to rocky outcrops in a range of habitats including paperbark forest, monsoon forest, tall open forest, open woodland, savannah, spinifex hill woodland, mixed shrubland, floodplain and deciduous vine thickets.</p>
<p><strong>Diet, Flight and Foraging. </strong>They are continuous flight forager that primarily searches for insects within and below the canopy of woodland and other forest types. In the Kimberley stomach contents contained the remains of moths bugs and caddis flies. In the Top End they eat mainly ants and beetles with a few flies, moths, mayflies and leaf-hoppers. They are most active in the first three hours after sunset. Speed of 15km/hr recorded WA</p>
<p><strong>Vocalisations and Echolocation </strong>Characteristic frequency is 59.6 kHz. This tiny bat (less than 5 grams in weight) has the highest characteristic frequency of any of the vespertilonid bats in the Top End. It can be readily identified from its curvilinear pulse shape and a characteristic frequency above 57.4 kHz.</p>
