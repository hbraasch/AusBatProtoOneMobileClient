<p><strong>Large Forest Bat</strong><br />
  <em>Vespadelus darlingtoni </em></p>
<p>(Allen, 1933)</p>
<p><strong>Description.</strong> A distinctive <em>Vespadelus</em> with its long fur and large size. It has dark brown to rusty brown fur.  The hairs are only mildly bicoloured with dark brown bases and slightly lighter brown tips. The skin on the ears and wings are very dark, the skin of the arm is the same colour as the wing membrane. The penis is small and has a distinctively angular shape, the tip is not swollen. It can be distinguished from all other species except the Eastern Forest Bat, <em>V. pumilus </em>by its short angled penis. <em>V. pumilus</em> is smaller with a forearm length of less than 33 mm (30.9 mm; 28.4 to 33.0 mm). A bat with a forearm of greater than 33.5 mm is most likely to be of this species in south-eastern Australia. In Tasmania fur colour varies from dark grey-brown in smaller individuals to very dark grey-brown or almost black in larger animals. In Victoria the bottom of the lower lip shows a dark brown or black triangle at the tip of the mouth. The tragus is usually dark. By running a finger lightly from the nose along the forehead to the ears a distinct bump or rise can be felt on the bridge of the nose. This helps to distinguish small female <em>V. darlingtoni</em> from large <em>V. regulus. </em></p>
<p><strong>Roost Habits.</strong> Colonies of up to 80 Large Forest Bats have been found in tree hollows but they are more commonly found in small groups of 5 to 6 females or as solitary males. These bats usually select large live trees for roosts, 20 to 40m high and commonly smooth barked. Roost entrances are 15 to 20 m above ground. They use multiple roosts changing most days to a new roost less than 1 km away. They are also found in buildings in colonies of up to 20. Males and females do not share roosts but either will roost in association with other bat species.</p>
<p><strong>Habitat.</strong> They are found in rainforest, wet and dry sclerophyll forest, blackwood swamps, open forest, subalpine woodland and alpine moors, sclerophyll regrowth and coastal mallee.</p>
<p><strong>Diet, Flight and Foraging. </strong>These bats are less maneuverable than most <em>Vespadelus</em>. They fly fast and avoid cluttered regrowth and rainforest by foraging mainly within the spaces among trees and between the canopy and the understorey. Their flight is characterised by rapid wing beats that are interrupted by gliding changes of direction to catch insects. Adapted to cool climates, they are able to forage during mild winter. In Victoria they eat ants, flies, bugs, and beetles, in equal quantities with occasional moths and spiders. In Tasmania they eat predominantly moths, but also take beetles, flies, bugs, lacewings, and termites. They can be distinguished from the Little Forest Bat, <em>V. vulturnus </em>and the Southern Forest Bat, <em>V. regulus</em> by their more direct flight and less agile attacking maneuvers. Foraging areas ranged from 10 ha to over 300 ha with individuals foraging for distances of up to 6 km during the night.</p>
<p><strong>Vocalisations and Echolocation.</strong><strong>&nbsp;</strong>Characteristic frequency varies gradually over distribution from 38 to 48.5 kHz (n = 89). Curved, tail absent or up-sweeping, characteristic section often long. In general, characteristic frequency decreases from the north east to the south east, west of the south east the characteristic frequency increases.</p>
<p>Where sympatric, can sometimes be distinguished from <em>Miniopterus orianae oceanensis</em> by having even, consecutive pulses and lacking down- sweeping tail. In the southern part of its range, calls below 43 kHz can be distinguished from M. orianae on frequency.</p>
