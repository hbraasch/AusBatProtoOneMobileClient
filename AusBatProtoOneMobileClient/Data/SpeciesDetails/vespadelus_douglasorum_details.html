<p><strong>Kimberley Cave Bat</strong>, <br />
<em>Vespadelus douglasorum</em></p>
<p>(Kitchener, 1976)</p>
<p><strong>Description.</strong> A large species of <em>Vespadelus</em> about which little is known, it has a forearm length of 34.3 to 37.8 mm. There are pronounced glandular pads on the muzzle and the skin on the face is a deep yellow to orange colour, darkest around the mouth, this appears to vary at different times of the year. Fur colour is a pale grey with slightly paler belly often with a yellow to orange tinge to the fur on the head and shoulders, also on the feet and forearm. The tip of the penis is bulbous and the glans penis is laterally compressed and rod shaped. It differs from the Northern Cave Bat, <em>V. caurinus,</em> by its much larger size and grey, instead of brown fur. Glandular pads on side of face give it a less pointed appearance than <em>V. caurinus. </em>Finlayson&rsquo;s Cave Bat,<em> V. finlaysoni</em> has dark brown fur and dark skin on the face, ears and forearms and the 3 Met to 3P1 ratio is greater than 0.35 (average of 0.38 versus 0.32 for <em>V. douglasorum</em>).</p>
<p><strong>Roost Habits.</strong> They are cave-dwelling bats forming mixed sex colonies of up to 200. I have found torpid individuals roosting in small clusters of 4 to 6 in cool and dry conditions (20oC and 25% humidity) in July, not far from the cave entrance. Alert (non-torpid) individuals were found deeper in the same cave in conditions of 27oC and 48% humidity<em>.</em> Even further in the cave where the temperature and humidity was very high there was a colony of Orange Diamond-faced Bats <em>Rhinonicteris aurantia </em>(S.C.)  Yellow-lipped Cave Bats occasionally share caves with Northern Cave Bats, <em>V. caurinus, </em>but roost in different areas. In May a colony of 36 were found roosting in a small limestone cave overhanging a large pool of water. They shared this cave with dusky Horseshoe Bats, <em>Hipposideros ater</em> and common Sheath-tailed Bats, <em>Taphozous georgianus</em>. A colony of 12 bats were found roosting in an abandoned building at Mt Hart.</p>
<p><strong>Habitat.</strong> Yellow-lipped Cave Bats have been caught in tropical woodlands, usually confined to very productive riparian environments, along <em>Melaleuca</em> and <em>Pandanus</em> lined waterways and adjacent open woodland. They use both sandstone and limestone caves, usually near water.</p>
<p><strong>Diet, Flight and Foraging. </strong>&nbsp;Their diet has not been studied. This bat has an agile foraging strategy, despite having only moderate flight musculature. Flight observations show that they use medium speed agile flight and fly very close to surfaces such as rocks and vegetation. Their flight involves long looping curves at moderate speeds, trees circling and occasional abrupt turns and turn arounds. Speeds of 21km/hr have been recorded.</p>
<p><strong>Notes </strong>Their echolocation call has a peak frequency of 52.8 kHz, range 78 to 52 kHz.</p>
