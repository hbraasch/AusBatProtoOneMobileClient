<p><strong>Finlayson&rsquo;s Cave Bat</strong><br />
  <em>Vespadelus finlaysoni </em></p>
<p>(Kitchener, Jones and Caputi 1987)</p>
<p><strong>Description. </strong>A bat of the arid interior, the fur is almost black with just the tips coloured either dark rust-brown or yellow brown. The belly is only slightly paler. The skin on the ears, face and wings is very dark. The fur is long and on the head it extends well onto the muzzle. The head of the glans penis is laterally compressed and rod shaped with an upward projecting narrow tongue of skin from the ventral tip. The dorsal surface has a deep longitudinal groove. The ventral surface has a slight ventral keel.</p>
<p><strong>Roost Habits.</strong> Finlayson&rsquo;s Cave Bats roost in the twilight area of caves and rock crevices and will readily roost in disused mines. Colony sizes of 2 to 20 are common but colonies of up to 500 are recorded. The sexes differ in their roosting behaviour. Females tend to roost in large clusters whereas males tend to roost in smaller groups, often in hard to reach crevices. They roost typically near the cave entrance. Preferred roosts tend to have very low humidity (less than 30% relative humidity) and although the temperature fluctuates widely from 16 to 35oC the bats rarely move between roost sites. I have found a colony of over 200 young, roosting separately from the adult bats, in a mine in western Queensland. They were roosting in a tightly clumped group in a warm area of the mine. When disturbed, they flew off and separated to join the small clusters of adults scattered throughout the mine.</p>
<p><strong>Habitat.</strong> Habitat types include grasslands, spinifex grasslands, savannah woodlands, tall open forest, mulga and other shrub communities. They usually live close to rocky outcrops or cavernous areas.</p>
<p><strong>Diet, Flight and Foraging.</strong>They are aerial foragers, but their diet has not been studied. They begin to hunt at dusk, foraging in cluttered air spaces within vegetation stands or while close contouring vegetation canopies, escarpments, scree slopes and other surfaces. During straight and level flight they reach speeds of 19.5 km/hr. Flight is often zigzagged, being a rapid, alternating series of near vertical rolls in opposite directions. They are commonly observed foraging over waterholes.</p>
<p><strong>Vocalisations and Echolocation. </strong>NT Vespadelus finlaysoni has a known distribution that extends into the south-east corner of the Top End (Churchill, 1998) and has a characteristic frequency of around 53 kHz (McKenzie and Muir, 2000).</p>
