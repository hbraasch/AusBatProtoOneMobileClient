<p><strong>Eastern Forest Bat</strong><br />
  <em>Vespadelus pumilus </em></p>
<p>(Gray, 1841)</p>
<p><strong>Description</strong>. The original &quot;little brown bat&quot;! The fur is dark chocolate brown on the back with an almost black base to the hairs, with lighter fur on the belly. It also extends to the dorsal surface of the tail membrane. Forearm length is 30.9 mm; 28.4 to 33.0 mm.  The wing membrane is black and the muzzle and ear skin is dark brown. The penis is small and has a distinctively angular shape, the tip is not swollen. The glans penis is a blunt rod shape and dorsoventrally compressed. It can be distinguished from all other species except the Large Forest Bat, <em>V. darlingtoni</em> by its short angled penis. <em>V. darlingtoni</em> is larger with a forearm length greater than 32.5 mm (35.1 mm: 32.5 to 37.2 mm).</p>
<p><strong>Habitat. </strong>They are known from sea level to the top of the Great Dividing Range, generally in moister forest, from tropical and subtropical rainforest, wet sclerophyll forest with rainforest gullies, and Bunya pine plantations. They are found in regrowth forest but show a strong preference for mature forests for roost sites.</p>
<p><strong>Roost Habits. </strong>Eastern Forest Bats roost primarily in tree hollows ranging from large cavities in hollow trunks to small hollows in the extremities of branches. They mostly use large mature trees, both dead and alive, which possess a diversity of hollows. Most females form large maternity roosts in tree hollows in November and colonies containing up to 54 bats have been recorded. Males generally roost alone although they share roosts with females during the mating season in April. Solitary males have been recorded roosting in dead <em>Acacia melanoxylon</em> trees with small hollows and within epiphytic elkhorn ferns. They use many different roosts that they usually change daily, although they may stay at the same site for up to 6 days. Roosts are usually only 100 m apart and are reused regularly. Maternity roosts are always close to creeks but with the onset of winter, roosts are more commonly in dead trees further up slope away from the water.</p>
<p><strong>Diet, Flight and Foraging. </strong>In northern New South Wales their diet is reported to consist of moths, beetles, flies, ants/wasps and bugs. Their foraging ranges are small, only 4 ha during the mating season in April and 6 ha when females are lactating in November. Foraging ranges overlap. They forage mainly within the spaces among trees and between the canopy and the understorey. Their flight is more maneuverable than the Large Forest Bat <em>V. darlingtoni. </em>They prefer to forage within mature forest rather than along flyways such as tracks. They avoid dense regrowth and in regrowth forest will favour the riparian zones. </p>
<p><strong>Vocalisations and Echolocation. </strong>Characteristic frequency 50.5 to 58 kHz (n = 50). Curved often with prominent up-sweeping tail. </p>
