<p><strong>Southern Forest Bat</strong><br />
  <em>Vespadelus regulus </em></p>
<p>(Thomas, 1906)</p>
<p><strong>Description</strong><strong>.</strong> A small species with a forearm of 28.0 to 36 mm<em>.</em> The dorsal fur  is grey-brown to  warm reddish brown with a paler belly. The fur is distinctly bicoloured with a dark base. The ears and wings are grey. In males the end of the penis is  pendulous and somewhat swollen. The glans penis is not compressed, and the urethral opening is enclosed by large lateral folds with secondary lateral folds at the base.  In Victoria, it is reported that the triangle at the bottom of the lower lip is the same colour as the surrounding skin. The tragus is usually dark. By running a finger lightly from the nose along the forehead to the ears the skull can be felt to be flat with no rise at the bridge of the nose. This distinguishes small <em>V. regulus</em> from large <em>V. vulturnus</em> and large <em>V. regulus</em> from <em>V. darlingtoni</em>.<em> V. baverstocki</em> and <em>V. vulturnus</em> are usually slightly smaller in forearm length.&nbsp; <em>V. darlingtoni,</em> differs by its angular penis. <em>V. baverstocki</em> also has a funnel shaped glans penis but lacks the secondary lateral folds. The glans penis of the <em>V. vulturnus</em>, is bulbous at the tip.</p>
<p><strong>Roost Habits</strong> These bats are found in colonies of 10 to 120 usually around 20 in tree hollows. In Western Australia their favoured roosts are in hollows in old large Jarrah and Marri trees (&gt;200 cm diameter) in intermediate or advanced stages of decay with crown senescence and deterioration. They show a strong preference for old growth forest and prefer tall trees with roost entrances high above the ground and with little surrounding vegetation. They change roosts every day, moving about 400m and sometimes returning to a roost after 2 to 4 days. In Victoria they have been shown to roost in dead timber, either dead trees or dead sections of live trees. Females select roosts in trees with dead timber offering multiple hollows and reduced canopy cover. Little forest bats on Phillip Island consistently chose roosts with entrance dimensions (1.9 &loz; 3.6 cm) that were not much larger than the bats&rsquo; cross section.</p>
<p>They commonly roost in houses around Adelaide. Males tend to roost separately from females except during the mating period. Roosts have been reported to contain either large numbers of females or small groups of males. In Tasmania they hibernate but presumably wake and forage regularly as they do not lose body weight over winter.</p>
<p><strong>Habitat</strong>. They are found in rainforest, wet and dry sclerophyll forest, shrubland and low shrub woodland, mixed temperate woodland, mallee and open woodland. The preservation of dead trees and stags is very important for this species</p>
<p><strong>Diet, Flight and Foraging. </strong>Southern Forest Bats are highly manoeuvrable, moderately fast aerial insectivores with flight speeds of 5 to 25 km/hr. Their diet in Tasmania consists predominantly of moths and beetles, with some flies, bugs and termites. In Victoria they eat mainly flies and moths, with occasional beetles, bugs and ants. They fly with great aerial agility, with rapid wing beats broken frequently by spiralling, gliding arcs as they change direction to attack flying insects. They tend to fly very close to vegetation and readily enter gaps in the understory at a height of less than 1 m. They forage at less than half the canopy height. They are capable from taking off from the ground with ease. They are more active on tracks in mature forests, and they have a small foraging range of less than 10 ha. They are sensitive to extreme forest fragmentation and avoid small forest remnants, corridors and open areas.</p>
<p>Little forest bats have a highly manoeuvrable flight pattern with &lsquo;clutter tolerant&rsquo; echolocation calls individuals were observed to circle roost trees repeatedly before leaving for foraging areas</p>
<p><strong>Vocalisations and Echolocation. T</strong>his bat shows abrupt and sizeable regional changes in echolocation call frequencies. In north-eastern New South Wales these are 45 to 46 kHz and in south-eastern New South Wales their calls are 40 to 43 kHz and in the Riverina district of south New South Wales their calls are 54 to 55 kHz. The significance of this is currently unknown but it has been suggested that these phonotypes may represent cryptic species.</p>
