<p><strong>Eastern Cave Bat</strong><br />
<em>Vespadelus troughtoni</em></p>
<p>(Kitchener, Jones and Caputi, 1987)</p>
<p><strong>Description. </strong>An uncommon bat, the fur on the back is light brown with ginger tips mainly around the head. The fur on the belly is dark at the base with light fawn tips. The penis is pendulous and not distinctly angular, and the end of the penis is slightly swollen. The head of the glans penis is laterally compressed with a deep furrow on the ventral surface and slight swellings on either side. The tip of the glans is blunt. The Large Forest Bat, <em>V. darlingtoni</em>, is a similar size but differs in its much smaller, angled penis. The Southern Forest Bat, <em>V. regulus</em>, the Little Forest Bat, <em>V. vulturnus</em>, and the Eastern Forest Bat, <em>V. pumilus</em>, have smaller forearms (less than 33.0 mm). Finlayson&rsquo;s Cave Bat, <em>V. finlaysoni</em>, is difficult to separate in central Queensland where they overlap is size. <em>V. finlaysoni</em> can be distinguished by the ratios of tibia to forearm length being greater than 0.39 and P2 to forearm greater than 0.32, and the glans penis having a pointed tip.</p>
<p><strong>Roost Habits.</strong> Eastern Cave Bats have been found roosting in small groups in sandstone overhang caves, boulder piles, mines and occasionally in buildings. They roost near the entrance in reasonably well lit areas, often in small avons or domes in the roof of caves as well as in cracks and crevices. Roost fidelity is low. They roost individually wedged into cracks or in colonies of 6 to 100 packed closely together in avons. The smaller colonies tend to be single sex. Maternity colonies of up to 240 adults have been found in shallow sandstone caves. A smaller maternity colony of 50 adults was found under the corrugated roof of a dairy shed. Roost microclimate stability appears be of low importance in maternity roost selection. They are commonly found in abandoned fairy martin nests under bridges and in culverts. Usually 2 to 3 bats roost together in unbroken nests.</p>
<p><strong>Habitat. </strong>All records are in close proximity to sandstone or volcanic escarpments. They inhabit tropical mixed woodland, wet and dry sclerophyll forest along the coast and the Great Dividing Range, extending into the drier forest of the western slopes and inland areas. This species has not been recorded during extensive surveys of forests in north eastern New South Wales suggesting that forests without natural roosting sites (caves or large rock overhangs) do not provide habitat for this species.</p>
<p><strong>Diet, Flight and Foraging. </strong>They forage over a small area. One male foraged for 5 consecutive nights in an area of only 33 ha. Another male foraged along a creek, remaining less than 10m above the surface and staying above the water rather than the surrounding vegetation. It used a circular back and forth flight along 20 m sections of the creek, changing frequently to new sections along a 200 m length. They are capable of flying 500 m over cleared paddocks. They have been observed hawking mosquitos.</p>
<p><strong>Vocalisations and Echolocation. </strong></p>
<p>Curved, often with up-sweeping tail. Characteristic frequency 48.5 to 55 kHz (n = 43). Similar to <em>Vespadelus pumilus</em>. If the end frequency is lower than 51 kHz, can be identified to <em>V. troughtoni</em>. If the end frequency is higher than 54.5 kHz, can be identified to <em>V. pumilus</em>. If the end frequency is between these two values, it could be either species. The up-sweeping tail is usually not as prominent as it can be in <em>V. pumilus</em>. </p>
