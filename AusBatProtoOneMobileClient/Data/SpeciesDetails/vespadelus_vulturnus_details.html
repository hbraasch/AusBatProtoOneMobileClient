<p><strong>Little Forest Bat</strong></p>
<p><em>Vespadelus vulturnus </em></p>
<p>(Thomas, 1914)</p>
<p><strong>Description</strong>. Australia's smallest bat. The fur colour is variable from brown to pale grey with a lighter belly. The hairs are bicoloured, being darker at the base, and vary from creamy white to brown or grey for the top one-third. The tragus is usually white or grey, and the ears and wings are pale. The skin on the forearm is paler than the wing membrane. The penis is pendulous and not distinctly angular. The end of the glans penis is distinctly round and bulbous. It is most likely to be confused with the Inland Forest Bat, <em>V. baverstocki</em>, which has a longer forearm at the same locality, and a funnel-shaped glans penis. There is considerable regional variation with individuals from arid or northern areas being smaller than those from mesic or southern areas. In Victoria, the triangle at the bottom of the lower lip is the same colour as the surrounding skin and fur. By running a finger lightly from the nose along the forehead to the ears a distinct bump or rise can be felt on the bridge of the nose. This distinguishes large <em>V. vulturnus</em> from small Southern Forest Bats <em>V. regulus. </em></p>
<p><strong>Roost Habits.</strong> Little Forest Bats roost in hollows, usually in dead trees or dead branches of live trees, often with multiple entrances. Hollow entrances are usually very small, only slightly larger than the bats. They also roost in the roof cavities of buildings. Colony sizes vary from solitary to 120 and are usually sexually segregated although juveniles and an occasional adult male may be found in a female colony. Roosts are usually near water, often in large trees along creeks and rivers.</p>
<p><strong>Habitat.</strong> They use a wide range of habitats including wet and dry sclerophyll forest, river red gum forest, montane and dry woodland, blackwood swamp, brigalow, mulga and mallee. In more arid areas they are mostly found in riverine habitats.</p>
<p><strong>Diet, Flight and Foraging. </strong>They forage within the upper levels of the forest understorey or in the spaces between trees, often very close to the foliage and always below the canopy. They fly with great aerial agility, with spiralling, gliding arcs as they change direction to catch flying insects. They forage up to 1.5 km from their roost sites. They take only flying prey and do not normally take food from the ground or from foliage. Larger prey may be caught and taken to a feeding roost to be eaten. These bats feed opportunistically, the diet reflecting local and seasonal variation in insect abundance and diversity. They eat predominantly moths, bugs and beetles with some flies, wasps, termites, ants, cockroaches and occasional spiders, grasshoppers and lacewings. Foraging area is 14 to 35 Ha. </p>
<p><strong>Vocalisations and Echolocation calls. </strong>This bat shows abrupt and sizeable regional changes in echolocation call frequencies. In south-east and central Queensland the calls range from 43 to 47 kHz, In coastal New South Wales they are 44 to 49 kHz and in southern New South Wales their calls are 49 to 53 kHz. It has been suggested that these phonotypes may represent cryptic species.</p>
